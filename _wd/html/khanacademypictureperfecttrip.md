Watch this [KhanAcademy HTML images tutorial](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/p/html-images)

Complete the activity [on KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/pc/challenge-a-picture-perfect-trip). If you don't want to use KhanAcademy's code editor, here is the [starter code](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ohiofi/43eb3dca51fe9b3141bdc4eff6182fe3/raw/4299c220d3a51bcd055ab66952003126e2b0acb6/A%2520picture-perfect%2520trip).

*** *NOTE:* You MUST use the HTML's img width setting to shrink your photos. Photos should be no wider than 500px wide and no taller than 500px tall. ***

If you don't want to use the pictures that KhanAcademy suggests, you can just copy/paste the URL of any image on the web.

When you're finished, copy all of the HTML code from KhanAcademy. Paste it into Notepad or Codecast.me or any other HTML editor and save it as an HTML file.

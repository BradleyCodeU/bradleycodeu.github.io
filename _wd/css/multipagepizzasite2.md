title: Multi-page Pizza Site 2
---

For this project you will continue working on your multi-page pizza site with the same group of 2-4 people.

### Each person will ADD ONE NEW PAGE (with an h1, text, and image) to the site.

Add an [HTML comment](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp) on each page that says the name of the programmer. For example, `<!-- coded by Mr. Riley -->`

The FINAL number of pages in the project is determined by the number of people:
  - 2 people = index.html homepage plus 4 other pages (add 2 new pages)
  - 3 people = index.html homepage plus 6 other pages (add 3 new pages)
  - 4 people = index.html homepage plus 8 other pages (add 4 new pages)

Ideas for "other pages" include: Pizzas, Wings, Pasta, Sides, Desserts, Drinks, Gift Cards, Deals, Our Locations, Our Story, Employment, Kids Club, Nutrition, Food Truck, Birthday Room, Contact Us

## Add CSS

Which type of CSS should you use?
  -   [Inline CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_inline)
  -   [Internal CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_internal)
  -   [External CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_external)

### Just like you split up the HTML coding work, you should split up the CSS coding work so that each person in the group writes some CSS code.

Use [CSS comments](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/comments-in-css/) to note the name of the programmer that wrote each rule. For example, `/* coded by Mr. Riley */`

Your website MUST have a consistent style across all pages:
      1. same navigation system (like a nav bar) on all pages
      1. your navigation uses a small (no larger than 100px wide) logo instead of saying "home." The logo is an anchor that links to index.html
      1. same colorful background (not black or white) on all pages
      1. same colorful text (not black or white) on all pages
      1. same link color (not the default blue) on all pages
      1. same visited link color (not the default purple) on all pages
      1. same solid 2 pixel black border around all images on all pages
      1. use a different font in your navigation (not the same as your normal text)
      1. use a different text color in your navigation (not the same as your normal text, not black or white)
      1. use a different background color in your navigation (not the same as the page background, not black or white)
      1. use a solid 2 pixel white border around the navigation on all pages

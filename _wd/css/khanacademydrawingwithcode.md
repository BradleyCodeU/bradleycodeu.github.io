Login to KhanAcademy here: [https://www.khanacademy.org/login](https://www.khanacademy.org/login)

Next go to [https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#drawing-basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#drawing-basics)

Watch these two KhanAcademy tutorials:
  - [Making drawings with code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/drawing-basics/pt/making-drawings-with-code)
  - [Coloring with code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/coloring/pt/coloring-with-code)

Then complete the following 3:

  - [Challenge: Simple Snowman](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/drawing-basics/pc/challenge-simple-snowman)
  - [Challenge: Sunny Snowy Day](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/drawing-basics/pc/challenge-waving-snowman)
  - [Project: What's For Dinner?](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/coloring/pp/project-whats-for-dinner)

*If you already have those 3 completed, complete any 3 of the 33 drawing with code challenges.* To complete this assignment, *you MUST complete 3 or more* of the coding challenges.

KhanAcademy saves your code and IF YOU ALREADY JOIN OUR KHANACAMEDY CLASS will allow me to see which challenges you've completed. When complete, return to Canvas and type "done" for the assignment.

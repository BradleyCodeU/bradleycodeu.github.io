Login to KhanAcademy here: [https://www.khanacademy.org/login](https://www.khanacademy.org/login)

Next go to [https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#drawing-basics](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#drawing-basics)

Complete the following 3:

  - [Challenge: Simple Snowman](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/drawing-basics/pc/challenge-simple-snowman)
  - [Challenge: Sunny Snowy Day](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/drawing-basics/pc/challenge-waving-snowman)
  - [Project: What's For Dinner?](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/coloring/pp/project-whats-for-dinner)

*If you already have those 3 completed, complete any 3 of the 33 drawing with code challenges.* To complete this assignment, *you MUST complete 3 or more* of the coding challenges.

KhanAcademy saves your code and will allow me to see which challenges you've completed. So there is nothing to "submit" for this assignment.

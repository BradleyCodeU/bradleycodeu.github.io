Create a simple audio player app.

## Directions

Upload 3 sounds.

Declare 3 variables that will store your sounds.

Add a preload() function and within preload you will use loadSound(). [https://p5js.org/reference/p5/loadSound/](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/loadSound/)

Use the p5js keyPressed() function to play a sound when a keyboard key is pressed. [https://p5js.org/reference/p5/keyPressed/](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/keyPressed/)

Display text on the canvas to tell the user what keyboard keys to press. [https://p5js.org/reference/p5/text/](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/text/)

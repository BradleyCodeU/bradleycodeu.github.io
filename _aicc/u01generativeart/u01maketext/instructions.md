Make a random text generator

# Directions

Decide what type of a generator you are going to make. Ideas include: Video Game Titles, New Sports Teams, Bad Guy Names and Powers, Heavy Metal Band Names, NPC Speech Text, Horse/My Little Pony/Unicorn Names, Harry Potter Characters, Celebrity Gossip News, Book Titles and Authors, Clickbait Article Titles, Random Poetry.

Create at least 3 lists. Each list MUST have 12 or more words. For example... a list of names, list of verbs, and a list of places.

Use the p5js random() method to choose a random item from each array. [https://p5js.org/reference/p5/random/](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/random/)

Concatenate the random items together.

Use the text() method to display the text on the canvas. [https://p5js.org/reference/p5/text/](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/text/)

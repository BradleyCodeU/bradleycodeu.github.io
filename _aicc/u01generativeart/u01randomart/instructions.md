Using P5.js create a Random Picture Generator or some Generative Art.

Generative Art is a process of algorithmically generating graphics/patterns/shapes often using randomness.

## Directions

Your project MUST have a limited color palette. At least 2 colors (not counting black and white). No more than 5 colors.

Your project MUST have 3 random elements. For example...
- Random shape (circle, square, triangle, etc.)
- Random size
- Random position
- Random color (from your chosen palette)
- Random rotation/angle

NOTE: You might want to remove the `background(128)` call so that your shapes are not being erased each loop.

NOTE: You could either write your code in the `setup()` function where the code will run once OR in the `draw()` function where it will loop repeatedly.



### Challenges

Include motion in order to create a generative art animation.

Add an interactive element. When the mouse is clicked or when the mouse moves.

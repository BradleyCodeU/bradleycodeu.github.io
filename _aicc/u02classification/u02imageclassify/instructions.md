Using Teachable Machine, train an Image Model to recognize either:
- 4 different objects AND to recognize "nothing"
- 4 different colors AND "nothing"

Once your model is trained, create a p5js project with ml5 and have it display text that shows both the top result AND the confidence (as a percent, rounded to a whole number). For example... "Water Bottle 98%"

If the condfidence score for the top result is ever less than 50%, then display some text or an emoji to let you know that the app is not sure. It should NEVER say "Water Bottle 45%"

You will use: [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

Show Mr Riley when finished.

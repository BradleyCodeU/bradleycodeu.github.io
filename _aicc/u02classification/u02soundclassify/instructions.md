Using Teachable Machine, teach a model to classify audio by recording short sound samples.

You could train your model to recognize words and/or other sounds.

Once your model is trained, create a p5js project with ml5 and have it display text that shows both the top result AND the confidence (as a percent, rounded to a whole number). For example... "Meow 98%"

If the condfidence score for the top result is ever less than 50%, then display some text or an emoji to let you know that the app is not sure. It should NEVER say "Meow 45%"

You will use: [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

FINAL STEP!!!

Create a generative art project in p5js that changes based on the words/sounds that the model heards. For example... using your voice, you could change the shapes or colors that appear.

Show Mr Riley when finished.

title: Capstone Part 1 Planning

Objective: Develop and analyze the performance of 2 predictive artificial intelligence models, focusing on data sourcing, ethical considerations, training, and testing for accuracy.

 

Either on your own OR with 1 partner, answer the following questions. Both partners must turn in a copy of the answers. Keep in mind that the final part of the exam will be an interview, so both partners must understand all parts of the data and models.

 

PART 1: PLANNING

This section focuses on understanding the problem space, defining the core challenge, and laying the groundwork for the AI system's design.

(Empathize) Stakeholder Analysis

Question 1: Who are you trying to help and what do they need? 

Aim to gain an understanding of the problem to be solved from multiple perspectives. Describe the primary user or group (the "stakeholder") who will benefit from this prediction.

- Identify the Stakeholder: Who is the target user? (for example, a hospital administrator, high school guidance counselor, insurance risk assessor).

-  Identify Their Needs: What specific decision do they need the AI to inform? How will a successful prediction change their behavior or process?

(Define) Problem Definition and Predictive Goal

This section requires defining the problem from both a human-centered design perspective and a technical AI perspective.

The Core Problem: Identify the issues (core problems) that need to be addressed in order to solve the predictive challenge. Sort and classify the core problems to understand the relationships between them, and how they will potentially affect the outcome.

Question 2: What are the core issues? 

List 2 or more underlying challenges and explain why this prediction is difficult or complex (for example, data privacy, bias and fairness, unpredictable external events, or complicated input variables).

The Final Predictive Question (Problem Statement)

State the final, clear, real-world problem your AI system is designed to solve using binary classification (a yes/no, true/false, 0/1 outcome).

Question 3: Phrase the question as "How Might We Predict _____?"  

Rephrase your problem statement into a human-centered question beginning with "How might we..." (for example, How might we help guidance counselors identify at-risk students before the third week of class?)

Question 4: Why did you choose this problem? 

Justification: Explain why you selected this problem. Briefly discuss its real-world relevance, potential societal or commercial impact, and why an AI solution is superior to traditional methods (like simple spreadsheets or human intuition).

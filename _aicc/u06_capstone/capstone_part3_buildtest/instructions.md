title: Capstone Part 3 Build and Test
---

Objective: Develop and analyze the performance of 2 predictive artificial intelligence models, focusing on data sourcing, ethical considerations, training, and testing for accuracy.

 

Either on your own OR with 1 partner, answer the following questions. Both partners must turn in a copy of the answers. Keep in mind that the final part of the exam will be an interview, so both partners must understand all parts of the data and models.

 

PART 3: BUILD & TEST

This section covers training the AI models and their performance with the testing data.

Present Two Solutions: Model 1 and Model 2

For this project, you will describe two distinct Logistic Regression A.I. models.

Ideate: It is time to be creative. All ideas should be considered. Ideas can address one or more of the core problems. Even an idea that results in a part of the solution is useful.

Prototype: An idea is selected to be developed. An engineer might make mock-ups, storyboards, staging, etc. The objective is to try things out and find the best solutions for the core problems based on the initial ideas.

Question 8: Describe Logistic A.I. Model 1

How does it work (in basic terms)? Describe the primary mechanism of a standard Logistic Regression model. Explain the role of the sigmoid function and how it converts a linear combination of inputs into a probability score (between 0 and 1) for your binary outcome.

Question 9: Describe Logistic A.I. Model 2

How does it work (in basic terms) and how does it differ from Model 1?

*** IMPORTANT! Model 2 *MUST* be either:

- an improved version of Model 1, using one specific algorithmic enhancement. Describe the model and explicitly state the difference.
- a completely different approach than Model 1. Describe the model and explicitly state the difference.

Performance Analysis

Give your models the training data and record the results.

Test: Test the final products against the defined problem and collect feedback from the product owner and/or end users. In our case, the feedback will come from the testing data.

Question 10: Draw A Confusion Matrix for Model 1 

Plot a confusion matrix for Model 1 based on its performance on the testing data. Clearly label the four quadrants (True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives). You must record your results in these quadrants.

You can either use a drawing tool like Notability OR just use text lines like this...

```

...|...|...
---+---+---
...|...|...
---+---+---
...|...|...

```

Question 11: Calculate Accuracy and F1 Score for Model 1

Using the numbers from your confusion matrix, calculate both the accuracy and F1 score of Model 1.

Question 12: Model 2, Draw A Confusion Matrix

Plot a confusion matrix for Model 2 based on its performance on the testing data. Clearly label the four quadrants (True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives). You must record your results in these quadrants.

Question 13:  Model 2, Calculate Accuracy and F1 Score

Using the numbers from your confusion matrix, calculate both the accuracy and F1 score of Model 2.

Question 14: Conclusion

Briefly conclude by stating which model performed better and answer the following 2 questions:

- What worked well?

- What improvements could you make?

title: Capstone Part 2 Data
---

Objective: Develop and analyze the performance of 2 predictive artificial intelligence models, focusing on data sourcing, ethical considerations, training, and testing for accuracy.

 

Either on your own OR with 1 partner, answer the following questions. Both partners must turn in a copy of the answers. Keep in mind that the final part of the exam will be an interview, so both partners must understand all parts of the data and models.

 

PART 2: DATA

Detail the data necessary to train and test your AI model.

Question 5: What are the inputs/features? 

List 2 or more specific features (input variables) the model will use to make its prediction (for example, student attendance rate, previous loan amount, number of Twitter followers, average weekly temperature).

Question 6: Describe how the necessary training data will be collected and how you separate training data and testing data. 

- Training Data Collection: Will it be downloaded from public databases like Kaggle, using sensors, or compiling historical records? Estimate a realistic size for your training dataset (for example, maybe 1000 records?).
- Testing Data Selection: Describe the methodology for selecting the testing data to ensure it is separate and representative of the real-world input. Specify the intended train/test split ratio (for example, maybe 80% training / 20% testing).

Question 7: Describe the assumptions, predicates, and constraints.

- Assumptions: List 2 or more critical assumptions, beliefs, or conditions that must be taken as true for your system to work effectively.
- Predicates: Describe 2 or more logical statements or conditions (True/False results) that could be used either within the AI model's logic or to filter/prepare the input data.
- Constraints: Identify 2 or more limits your system would face
    - Technical Constraints: (e.g., computational limits, latency requirements)
    - Legal/Regulatory Constraints: (e.g., GDPR, anti-discrimination laws)
    - Ethical Constraints: (e.g., bias mitigation, transparency)

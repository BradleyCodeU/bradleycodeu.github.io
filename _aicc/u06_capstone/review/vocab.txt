Accuracy The percentage of correct predictions within a model.
AI AI (artificial intelligence) is intelligence that can be programmed to mimic human intelligence.
Algorithm A set of rules used to generate calculations or perform problem-solving operations.
Anomaly An unusual activity in a group of otherwise normal activities.
Attack Surface The parts of data or a system that are vulnerable to attack.
AUC AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a model's probability of choosing a positive instance over a negative
instance.
Bias An imbalance in data that can cause data to be skewed toward a demographic group, which can
harm an AI machine-learning model.
Classification A model type in which a result is categorized, usually with one of two values, such as a yes or no
value.
Data at Rest Data stored on an on-premises or cloud storage drive.
Data in Transit Data in the process of being copied or moved from one location to another.
F1 Score The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Feature An input to an AI model used to generate output.
Labeled Data Data that is paired with output targets in an AI model.
Linear
Regression
A form of regression in which an outcome is a continuous variable, like a number.
Logistic
Regression
A form of regression in which an outcome uses binary dependent variables.
Model An app used to generate predictions and outcomes based on the entering and training of data
entered into the app.
Natural
Language
Processing
A form of AI that reads data from text and images and can include speech recognition and object
detection.
Precision The percentage of true positive predictions among all positive predictions in an outcome.
RBAC RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a permission standard in which permissions are assigned to
roles, and roles are assigned to individuals and groups.
Recall The measure of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
Regression A model type that looks at the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more
independent variables.
Reinforcement
Learning
A type of machine learning model that involves an AI agent performing actions that maximize a
certain reward.
Risk Register A document that contains known risks for a project and the impact, probability, and mitigation
strategy for those risks.
ROC ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) is the plot of the True Positive Rate against the False
Positive Rate for model results.
R-Squared A value that measures the proportion of variance of a dependent variable that is predictable from
independent variables.
Scalability The ability to adjust machine resources up or down depending upon workload demand for one or
more apps on that machine.
SME SME (Subject Matter Expert) is an expert on the problem or problems attempting to be solved
through the use of an AI model.
Transparency In the context of AI, the act of being forthright about how data is collected and used for AI models

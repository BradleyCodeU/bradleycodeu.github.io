title: localStorage Shopping List v1
---
In this project, you will create an app that allows you to store a list of items for a long time. It's currently a Shopping List App, but I want you to change that and design it for your own purpose. For example...
  - Video Game Collection App
  - Favorite Pizza Places App
  - Homework "To Do" List App
  - Movies You Want To Watch App
  - Favorite TV Shows App
  - Chores List App
  - Holiday Wishlist App

Complete the JavaScript and some custom CSS to style your app. [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)

IN A NEW FILE, create a JavaScript class [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp) that will serve as a blueprint for a shopping list item. Create properties (instance variables) for the attributes that you need to store for each shopping list item.

In version 2 we will improve the app.

Show Mr Riley when finished

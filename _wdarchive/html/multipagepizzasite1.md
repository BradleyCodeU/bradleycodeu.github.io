For this project you will work in a group of 2-4 people. The number of pages in the project is determined by the number of people:
  - 2 people = index.html homepage plus 2 other pages
  - 3 people = index.html homepage plus 3 other pages
  - 4 people = index.html homepage plus 4 other pages

Ideas for "other pages" include: Pizzas, Wings, Pasta, Sides, Desserts, Drinks, Gift Cards, Deals, Our Locations, Our Story, Employment, Kids Club, Nutrition, Food Truck, Birthday Room, Contact Us

Your website must contain:
  1.  an index.html homepage page with a logo and links to all of the other pages
  1.  all other pages have:
      - same navigation system (like a nav bar) as all pages with links to every page on the site
      - an h1
      - a paragraph with some text
      - one (or more) images

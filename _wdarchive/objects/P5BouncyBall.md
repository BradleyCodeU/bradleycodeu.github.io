Create a simple P5.js animation that shows a bouncing ball.

Here is the link to the P5.js reference: [https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape)

You MUST have:

  - A square/rectangle that shows the "walls"
  - A [Javascript object](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp){:target="_blank"} to keep track of the ball's x, y, xSpeed, and ySpeed

Use the size of your square/rectangle to determine the walls. If your square is 500 x 500, then the lowest x-coordinate is 0 and the largest x-coordinate is 500. The lowest y-coordinate is 0 and the largest y-coordinate is 500.

### If you have already completed 1 or more Computer Science classes...
Create a simple brick-breaker game with a user-controlled rectangle "paddle" at the bottom of the play area. The ball bounces off the walls and the paddle. You lose if the ball hits the bottom of the play area.

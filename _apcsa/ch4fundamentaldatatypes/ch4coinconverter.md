Given an amount of dollars and cents (entered as a decimal number such as 2.44), convert that amount of money into denominations of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

I recommend first converting the decimal amount into a integer amount of cents. Then use integer division and modulus for the unit conversions. Finally, use printf to display the results.

### Sample Run 1
```
Enter the amount to convert to coins in dollars and cents (for example, 3.41): 2.44
  Dollars: 2
 Quarters: 1
    Dimes: 1
  Nickels: 1
  Pennies: 4
```

### Sample Run 2
```
Enter the amount to convert to coins in dollars and cents (for example, 3.41): 5.55
  Dollars: 5
 Quarters: 2
    Dimes: 0
  Nickels: 1
  Pennies: 0
```

### Sample Run 3
```
Enter the amount to convert to coins in dollars and cents (for example, 3.41): 9.99
  Dollars: 9
 Quarters: 3
    Dimes: 2
  Nickels: 0
  Pennies: 4
```

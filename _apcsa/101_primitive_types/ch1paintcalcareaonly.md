You are painting a room and need to calculate the amount of paint that must be purchased. All length and area calculations will be in feet and will be entered and stored as integers.

Prompt the user for the length, width, and height of a room.

Prompt the user for the number of doors and number of windows.

Assume that doors are 21 square feet and windows are 12 square feet.

Calculate and display the area to be painted. (*NOTE*: You will NOT be painting the ceiling, floors, doors or windows.)

Write a program that reads an integer and displays, using asterisks, a filled and hollow square, placed next to each other. For example, if the side length is 5, the program should display:

```
Enter side length: 5
***** *****
***** *   *
***** *   *
***** *   *
***** *****
```

NOTICE: Your squares MUST be placed next to each other horizontally. Like this...
```
Enter side length: 3
*** ***
*** * *
*** ***
```
Your squares must NOT look like this...
```
***
***  
***

***
* *  // Do NOT do this
***
```

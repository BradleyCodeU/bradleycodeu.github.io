Write For loops that will compute

1. The sum of all even numbers between 2 and a (inclusive).

1. The sum of all squares between 1 and a (inclusive).

1. The sum of all odd numbers between a and b (inclusive).

1. The sum of all odd digits of a. (For example, if a is 32677, the sum would be 3 + 7 + 7 = 17.)



Sample output 1
```
Gimme a positive integer: 135
The sum of all even numbers between 2 and 135 = 4556
The sum of all squares between 1 and 135 = 506
Gimme a positive integer larger than 135: 138
The sum of all odd numbers between 135 and 138 = 272
The sum of all odd digits of 135 = 9
```

Sample output 2
```
Gimme a positive integer: 123
The sum of all even numbers between 2 and 123 = 3782
The sum of all squares between 1 and 123 = 506
Gimme a positive integer larger than 123: 124
The sum of all odd numbers between 123 and 124 = 123
The sum of all odd digits of 123 = 4

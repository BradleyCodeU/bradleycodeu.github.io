You will complete 4 exercises for this assignment.

### Part 1 of 4
    
Run the following. Then modify it to print “Hello, name!”, displaying the name that the user typed in.
```
String name = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("What is your name?");
System.out.println(name);
```
In addition to saying “Hello, name!” in the console, can you say "Hello, name!" in a JOptionPane MessageDialog?

### Part 2 of 4

Write code so that the dialog continues with the message "My name is Hal! What would you like me to do?" Discard the user’s input and display a message such as I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. Replace Dave with the name that was provided by the user. Display the "I'm sorry" message using a JOptionPane MessageDialog.

### Part 3 of 4

Run the following. Then modify it to show a different greeting and image.

If you have trouble finding an image that works, try searching Wikimedia for an image https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

In this exercise, you will explore a simple way of visualizing a Rectangle object. The setBounds method of the JFrame class moves a frame window to a given rectangle. Complete the following program to visually show the translate method of the Rectangle class.

**NOTE**: In computer science, the y-axis is inverted and 0,0 is in the top-left corner of the screen.

Construct a rectangle and set the frame bounds

Move the rectangle and set the frame bounds again

Translate the rectangle again and set the frame bounds again

    // In Java 8, the LocalDate class describes a calendar date that does not depend on a location or time zone. You construct a date like this:
    // <pre>
    // LocalDate today = LocalDate.now(); // Today’s date
    // LocalDate eckertsBirthday = LocalDate.of(1919, 4, 9);
    // </pre>
    
    // The plusDays method can be used to add a number of days to a LocalDate object:
    // <pre>
    // LocalDate later = today.plusDays(10); // Ten days from today
    // </pre>
    
    // This method does not mutate the today object, but it returns a new object that is a given number of days away from today. To get the year of a day, call
    // <pre>
    // int year = today.getYear();
    // </pre>
    
    // To get the weekday of a LocalDate, call
    // <pre>
    // String weekday = today.getDayOfWeek().toString();
    // </pre>
    
    // Your task is to write a program that prints
    
    //   - The weekday of “Pi day”, that is, March 14, of the current year.
    //   - The date and weekday of “Programmer’s day” in the current year; that is, the 256th day of the year. (The number 256, or 28, is useful for some programming tasks.)
    //   - The date and weekday of the date that is 10,000 days earlier than today.

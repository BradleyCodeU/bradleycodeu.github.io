Create a class for a RandomPitcher

  // Your RandomPitcher class MUST:
  // - have 5 or more instance variables
  // - have 5 getter methods
  // - have a toString() method
  // - have a getPitch() method that uses the pitcher's stats and generates random pitches
  //   - some ideas for types of pitches that COULD be thrown... fastball, curveball, slider, changeup, screwball, knuckleball
  //   - here is a different idea. a pitch COULD be... high and outside, low and outside, high and inside, low and inside
  // - only use the Math.random() method to generate random numbers

Your Main class MUST:
- construct two different RandomPitcher objects
- print the stats for each RandomPitcher object
- throw a few pitches and demonstrate that the pitches are random

# Array List Review Wordlists
---
These exercises will allow you to have some practice with the idea of ArrayLists, and more practice with programs structured using functions and procedures.

Objectives: Practice with programming fundamentals, Variables, Declaration and Assignment, Primitive types Arithmetic Expressions Simple keyboard input and text display output Branching ­ if­-else-if-­else syntax Loops ­ simple while loops, nested while loops Methods ­ functions and procedures ArrayLists ­ collections of variables

Works towards the following Course Goals: Competency with using basic coding features of a high ­level imperative programming language Competency with writing computer programs to implement given simple algorithms Familiarity with designing simple text ­oriented user interfaces

You will be writing a simple Java program that implements a few basic ArrayList manipulations. You will write code that takes two lists of words as input from the command line and stores them in separate ArrayLists. Note that the 'XXX' given to end input should be case insensitive (i.e. the code should terminate whether the user enters capital XXX or lowercase xxx). The program will merge the two lists together, alternating between elements of list1 and list2 until all values from both lists have been copied into the new list. If list1 is shorter than list2, the remaining elements of list2 will be appended to the end of the merged list. Likewise, if list2 is shorter than list1, the remaining elements of list1 will be appended to the end of the merged list. The original lists should be intact when your method ends (i.e. make no changes to list1 and list2 in the body of your method).

*****Create methods getList(), displayList(), and mergeLists() to complete this exercise*****

  - getList() should use the following method header: private static ArrayList<String> getList(Scanner inScanner). Prompts the user to Enter a word ('XXX' to quit): and loops until the user types "XXX". Returns an ArrayList of all the words that the user typed before "XXX".
  - displayList() should use the following method header: private static void displayList(ArrayList<String> myList). Returns nothing. Prints the contents of myList Each item on a new line with index numbers. argument ["a"] would print 0: a and argument ["a", "b"] would print...
```
0: a
1: b
```
  - mergeList() should use the following method header: private static ArrayList<String> mergeLists(ArrayList<String> list1, ArrayList<String> list2) It should take two lists of Strings as input. Adding items from list1, then list2, then list 1, then list2, etc.
    - Example 1: with arguments ["a", "b", "c", "d"] and ["x", "y"] then it would return ["a", "x", "b", "y", "c", "d"]
    - Example 2: with arguments ["rr", "ss"] and ["gg", "hh", "ii", "jj"] then it would return ["rr", "gg", "ss", "hh", "ii", "jj"]
    - Example 3: with arguments ["za"] and ["ma", "na", "pa"] then it would return ["za", "ma", "na", "pa"]
    - Example 4: with arguments [ ] and ["f"] then it would return ["f"]



Sample Output This is a sample transcript of what your program should do.
```
Enter the first wordlist:
Enter a word ('XXX' to quit): a
Enter a word ('XXX' to quit): b
Enter a word ('XXX' to quit): xxx
Enter the second wordlist:
Enter a word ('XXX' to quit): x
Enter a word ('XXX' to quit): y
Enter a word ('XXX' to quit): z
Enter a word ('XXX' to quit): xxx

/*
Summary of Chapters 1 & 2
*/

// 1) Write the import statements for the Rectangle class, the Scanner class, the Random class and the Math class

// 2) Write the import statement needed for question 9 (below)


public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// 3) Write MULTIPLE output statements that will produce a smiley face (like in the ASCII art project)


		// 4) Write a program that constructs three identical square Rectangle objects with
		//    top-left corner (100, 100) and side length 200. Print their starting locations,
		//		apply the grow and translate methods, and print the ending locations again.
		//		The calls to grow and translate should modify the squares so that each
		//		square is half the size of the previous (final sizes should be 200 x 200, 100 x 100,
		//		and 50 x 50) and so that all squares are translated back to the origin (100, 100).


		// 5) Simulate a dice roll. Using an object of the Random class, generate and print a random integer between 1 and 6, inclusive. 

    
    // 6) Same as question 5, but use Math.random() instead of the Random object.


		// 7) Using your Random object, pick a random room. Generate and print a random integer between 100 and 134, inclusive.

    
    // 8) Same as question 7, but use Math.random() instead of the Random object.


		// 9) Display the day of the week that Mr. Riley's birthday (June 15th) was on this year.


		// 10) Create a String variable and set it to be "Bradley". Then, call the appropriate String method to print the number of letters in the word "Bradley".


		// 11) Finally, visit http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ to get a fancy ASCII art version of your LAST name. For example, Amy Brown would print Brown. Use println statements to print your ASCII art last name.

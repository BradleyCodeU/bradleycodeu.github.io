Create one Java program that does all of the following:

R2.9 Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Hello" and then change it to "HELLO". Use the toUpperCase method.

R2.10 Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Hello" and then change it to "hello". Use the replace method.

E2.3 Write a program that initializes a string with "Mississippi". Then replace all "i" with "ii" and print the length of the resulting string. In that string, replace all "ss" with "s" and print the length of the resulting string.

E2.8 The StringBuilder class has a method for reversing a string. In a ReverseTester class, construct a StringBuilder from a given string (such as "desserts"), call the reverse method followed by the toString method, and print the result. Also print the expected value.

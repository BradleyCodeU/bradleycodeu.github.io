# Cedar Point Calc
---
NOTE: You do NOT need to use any "if" statements for this project

Mr. Cook has decided to send all student class officers from grades 7 - 12 to Cedar Point to thank them for their work. He doesn't know *exactly* how many students will be attending right now, but he has asked you to write a program that can  calculate and display the total expenses of the trip.

He will need to send 1 teacher chaperone for every 4 students (rounded down).

The trip could EITHER be held in the fall or held in the spring. Calculate and display the costs for both options.
- Fall admission price is $43 per ticket for students and $43 per chaperone. Spring admission is $36.99 per student and $45.99 per chaperones.
- Every 16th STUDENT earns a coupon for 1 free student admission (either -$43 in fall or -$36.99 in spring). If 33 students go, then you'd earn 2 free student admission coupons.

They could EITHER take school buses ($1300.42 per 44 person bus) or take charter buses ($1738.92 per 55 person bus). Calculate and display the costs for both options.

Finally, Mr. Cook needs to budget a $25 food allowance for every chaperone and student.

Write a program LotteryPrinter that picks a combination in a lottery. In this lottery, players can choose 6 numbers (possibly repeated) between 1 and 49. Construct an object of the Random class (see [Exercise •• E2.12](https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781119141594/epub/OEBPS/bjeo6_ch02-33.xhtml#_idTextAnchor257)) and invoke an appropriate method to generate each number. (In a real lottery, repetitions aren’t allowed, but we haven’t yet discussed the programming constructs that would be required to deal with that problem.) Your program should print out a sentence such as “Play this combination—it’ll make you rich!”, followed by a lottery combination.

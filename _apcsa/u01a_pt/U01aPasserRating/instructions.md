# Passer Rating



Passer rating (also known as passing efficiency in college football) is a measure of the performance of passers, primarily quarterbacks, in gridiron football. Passer rating is calculated using a player's pass attempts, completions, yards, touchdowns, and interceptions. Passer rating in the NFL is on a scale from 0 to 158.3.

Since 1973, passer rating has been the official formula used by the NFL to determine its passing leader.

Passer rating is sometimes colloquially referred to as “quarterback rating” or “QB rating”, however the statistic applies only to passing (not to other contributions by a quarterback) and applies to any player at any position who throws a forward pass, not just to quarterbacks.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Although QB stats such as attempts would LOGICALLY be stored as an integer, you will need to convert the attempts to double (aka convert from int to decimal numbers) in order to avoid an incorrect result caused by [integer division](https://www.educative.io/answers/wrong-results-for-division-in-java).  When dividing two integers, Java uses integer division and the result is also an integer. The result is truncated (the fractional part is thrown away) and NOT rounded to the closest integer. `7 / 4` in Java will equal 1. However `7.0 / 4` (or `7 / 4.0` or `7.0 / 4.0`) would equal 1.75.

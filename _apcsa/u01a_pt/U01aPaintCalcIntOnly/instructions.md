You are painting a room and need to calculate the amount of paint that must be purchased. All length and area calculations will be in feet and will be entered and stored as integers. Even the final cost will be an integer.

- Fill in the body of the static method calculateWallArea(intlength, width, height, num_doors, num_windows)
Assume that doors are 21 square feet and windows are 12 square feet.

- In the main method...
  - Prompt the user for the length, width, height, etc.
  - Use Scanner to collect keyboard input
  - Use the methods to calculate the results
  - Display the results


Calculate and display the area to be painted. (NOTE: You will NOT be painting the ceiling, floors, doors or windows.)

### Sample run #1:

Concepts covered in this project: ArrayList, the limits of FOR EACH loops. In certain use cases, a FOR EACH loop will generate errors.

Read this [w3schools ArrayList tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arraylist.asp){:target="_blank"}

Use an ArrayList to store your favorite toppings for pizza.

Detailed directions are given as comments in the starter code.

NOTE: WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, YOU MUST RUN YOUR CODE AND FIX ANY ERRORS.

ASCII art

Create a new Java project. In that one project, complete **six** of the following Java exercises.

## Part 1
Choose 1 of either: E1.2 or E1.3

  - E1.2: Write a program that prints the sum of the first ten positive integers, `1 + 2 + … + 10`
  - E1.3: Write a program that prints the product of the first ten positive integers, `1 * 2 * … * 10`

## Part 2
Choose any 4 of these: E1.5, E1.6, E1.7, E1.8, E1.10, E1.11

  - E1.5: Write a program that displays your name inside a box on the screen, like the following. Do your best to approximate lines with characters such as `- +` and `|`.

```
+----+
|Dave|
+----+
```

  - E1.6: Write a program that prints your name in large letters.

```
*   *    **    ****    ****   *   *
*   *   *  *   *   *   *   *  *   *
*****  *    *  ****    ****    * *
*   *  ******  *   *   *   *    *
*   *  *    *  *    *  *    *   *
```

  - E1.7: Write a program that prints your name in Morse code, like this `.... .- .-. .-. -.--` Use a separate call to System.out.print for each letter.

  - E1.8: Write a program that prints a face similar to (but different from) the following:

```
  /////
 +"""""+
(| o o |)
 |  ^  |
 | '-' |
 +-----+
```

  - E1.10: Write a program that prints a house that looks exactly like the following:

```
   +
  + +
 +   +
+-----+
| .-. |
| | | |
+-+-+-+
```

  - E1.11: Write a program that prints a house that looks exactly like the following:

```
 /\_/\     -----
( ' ' )  / Hello \
(  -  ) <  Junior |
 | | |   \ Coder!/
(__|__)    -----
```

## Part 3
Finally, visit [http://patorjk.com/software/taag/](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/) to get a fancy ASCII art version of your first name. Use println statements to print your ASCII art name.

# Instructions  

  
Finish the two static methods below. You can go out if you do not need to do homework, you have done the dishes, you've done at least 4 math problems, and practiced piano for at least 10 minutes. 


STEP 1: create a static method named canGoOut that returns true if you can go out, and false if you can't. Must have 4 parameters, haveHomework, didDishes, mathProblemsCompleted, and pianoMinutes.
  

STEP 2: create a static method named tasksNeeded to return a String that contains the tasks you need to do in order to go out OR returns "You can go out". Must have 4 parameters, haveHomework, didDishes, mathProblemsCompleted, and pianoMinutes. 

If no homework and dishes are done, but 0 math and 0 piano... it would return "You must complete at least 4 math problems. You must practice piano for at least 10 minutes."

If all 4 chores are not completed then it would return "You must do your homework. You must do the dishes. You must complete at least 4 math problems. You must practice piano for at least 10 minutes."

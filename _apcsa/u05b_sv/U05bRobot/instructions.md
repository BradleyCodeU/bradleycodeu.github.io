### Static Variable

When a variable is declared "static" in Java programming, it means that the
variable belongs to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the
class. This means that there is only one copy of the variable in memory.
Imagine a class as a "car factory" and an instance as one individual car. Each
car should remember the basic facts about itself. Each car does NOT need to
remember things like... every possible car color, the id numbers of all cars, how
many cars have been created.
A typical use-case for a static variable is a counter variable that increases
every time an object is constructed. In order to keep this counter variable safe,
we will want to declare it private.

### Static Methods

Getter and setter methods are used to work with an individual instance. Those are
non-static methods. A "static" method is a method that is part of a class rather
than an instance. Static methods can do basic math, generate random stuff, and
access static variables.
Think about the kind of tasks that the Honda "car factory" might do: pick a new
random ID number, lookup the part numbers for any Honda car/truck, get the
average price of Honda vehicle given the year and model, check the availability
of a specific car model at nearby dealerships. These are not tasks that an
individual car should need to perform.
A typical use-case for a static method is a helper method. For example, a Car
class could have a static method to calculate the driving time between two
cities. We don't need to know anything about an individual car to make that
calculation.

## Directions

Implement a class Robot (in the Robot.java file) that simulates a robot wandering
on an infinite plane. The robot is located at a point with integer coordinates
and faces north, east, south, or west. 

Supply the following constructor and methods:

- public Robot(Point startingLocation, int startingDirection)
   - Note: 0 = North,
1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West

- turnLeft and turnRight
    - public void turnLeft()
    - public void turnRight()
    - For the left and right methods, check the robot's current direction value and update it accordingly based on whether it is turning left or right.
    - The turnLeft and turnRight methods change the direction but not the location. 


- public void move()
    - For the move method, check the robot's current direction value and update its location by one unit in that direction. Since this is a computer science graph, **remember** that increasing the y-value moves downward, and decreasing the y-value moves upward.
    - The move method moves the robot by one unit in the direction it is facing. 
- public Point getLocation()
- public String getDirection()
    - The getDirection method returns a string "N", "E", "S", or "W".



Finally, create the following static variable/methods:
- a static variable to track the amount of robots that have been constructed
- a static ArrayList of used license plate numbers that have already been generated
- a static method named getRobotCount() that will return the amount of robots that have been constructed
- a static method String getLicensePlates() that returns the toString version of the license plate numbers ArrayList
- a static method String generateLicensePlateNumber() that will generate a String length 7 of random uppercase-letters and numbers, add it to the ArrayList of used license plate numbers (NOTE: use the ArrayList add() method), and return the String

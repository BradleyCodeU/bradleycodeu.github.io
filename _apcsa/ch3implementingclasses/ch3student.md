Implement a class Student. For the purpose of this exercise, a student has a name and a total quiz score. Supply an appropriate constructor and methods...
  - getName()
  - addQuiz(int score)
  - getTotalScore()
  - getAverageScore()

To compute the average, you also MUST track the number of quizzes that the student has taken. You are not storing the individual quiz scores in a list, instead you are keeping a running total. Supply a StudentTester class that tests all methods.

A FarmersMarket is a food market at which local farmers sell fruit and vegetables and often meat, cheese, and bakery products directly to consumers.

In this project you will complete the FarmersMarket class. Each FarmersMarket has...

- a name 
- an array of PriceTracker objects that can calculate prices


In addition to instance variables there are two static variables that belong to the class...

- static String array of city names
- static int cityCounter to keep track of the current city index

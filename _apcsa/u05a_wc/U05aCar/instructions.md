# Ch3 Car
---

Directions:

- Car class: Complete the two constructors and the setPosition method. In the constructors, you will also set carColor to one of the [java.awt.Color constants](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html). For example, Color.BLUE
- CarTester class: ADD TWO MORE CARS near the middle of the window using the no-argument constructor and the setPosition method. Your final project will have 4 visible car objects.

5.13. Free Response Question (FRQ) for Classes

As of 2019, the AP examâ€™s second free response question (FRQ) is on classes, where students design and implement a described class. This question involves creating a class with private instance variables and public methods. The College Board will provide a description of the class and the methods. This question does not involve more complex topics such as arrays.

To succeed on the FRQ Question 2 on Classes, you must know how to:

- Create a class using public class Classname { }

- Write a constructor with the same name as the class and no return type. This constructor will probably have a parameter that is assigned to an instance variable and will need to assign default values to the other instance variables.

- Write public methods in the class that use the instance variables as well as parameters and return values. These methods will probably use if statements but not more complex coding. One of these methods will probably be an accessor method that returns an instance variable or a calculated value that is dependent on the instance variables, and one will probably be a mutator method that changes the value of an instance variable.

Read through the memberships and products that will be available at the
[Pet Store Startup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XDHp466QvmM56X6C90JBB-IRpWRjf9vW2Tv9VUUtv5w/edit?usp=sharing) and create a UML Diagram that plans the instance variables and methods for each class. Remember to only create a separate class for differences in *behavior*. For example, there are 4 types of customer membership but you should only create 1 parent class and 1 or 2 child classes.

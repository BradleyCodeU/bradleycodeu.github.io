This game is based on Java Tradewars by Rob Hurring

Java Tradewars
--------------

Java Tradewars is a generic engine that can be easily re-themed. There is no XML to configure, just straight java. This project is an homage to one of my favorite oldschool games :)

I tried to keep the tradewars package outside of swing where I could, so it can be easily adapted to a console game if you wanted. 


Customization
-------------

Customizing this game is done in the `tradewars.Game` file. Here is the general list of things to customize:

* Events: these are things that happen while moving around
  * Finding cash/stuff on the ground
  * Fights
  * Healing events
  * Bigger storage
  * etc.
* NPCs: these are the bad guys you fight
* Products: these are what can be bought/sold at the marketplace
* Locations: where to go?

Customizing Products
--------------------

To create a custom product you need a few things

    new Product(String name, int lowPrice, int highPrice, String lowMessage, String highMessage);
    
    // Example
    new Product("Product Name", 100, 500);
    new Product("Product Name", 100, 500, "%s prices have bottomed out!", "%s prices are at an all-time high!");
    
    // Add a bunch to Game.java
    final static private Product[] products = {
      new Product("Product Name", 100, 500)
    };
    
and you're off the the races. The movement will randomize the prices between the high and low numbers. Randomly the prices will spike. You can adjust this in the
`Product.EVENT_CHANCE` constant.

Customizing Locations
---------------------

This is run almost exactly like products. You specify an array of `Locations` to the game class to use. Each location can use a customized array of products.
  
    new Location(String name, Product[] products_to_sell);
    
    // Add a bunch to Game.java
    final static private Location[] locations = {
        new Location("Coney Island", products),
        new Location("Manhattan", products)
    };
    
Customizing NPCs
----------------

If you chose to enable fights, these are the guys that randomly appear. The `Game.startFight` method will try to match levels with the player if one is given,
otherwise it is randomized.

    new Npc(String name, int maxHealth, int strength, int defense, long low, long high, int level);
    
    // Example:
    new Npc("Bossman", 500, 25, 5, 1000, 3000, 5);
    
    // Add a bunch to Game.java
    final static private Npc[] npcs = {
        new Npc("Street Thug", 20, 20, 5, 2000, 5000, 1)
    };
    
Bossman will only show up when the player is level 5+ and will reward between 1-3k cash.

Customizing Events
------------------

Events are a bit trickier since they can encompass so many different things. A generic event will have access to the game, player and return messages. There are
2 basic ways events are used.

1. Prompt the user for an action and request a response (yes/no)
2. Notify the user of something that happened (no response necessary)


To trigger an event the `inEvent()` method should return true. there is a `hit` helper to assist with this -- pass in a number and it will match a random number against
it. For examples of events, check the `tradewars.events` package.

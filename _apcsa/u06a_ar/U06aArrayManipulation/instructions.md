# Array Manipulation
---
Manipulate data stored in an array.

Part 1:
  - In public static void main, create an array that will store 10 **random** integers from 10 to 100. Use Math.random() [https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_howto_random_number.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_howto_random_number.asp)

  - Print "Initial random array = " the print the contents of the array.

Part 2:
  - In public static void main, Print "Smallest value = " then find and print the smallest value stored in the array.

  - Print "Sum = " then calculate and print the sum of all items in the array.

  - Compute the sum of the array values, except for the smallest one. Print "Sum without smallest = " and print the sum of all items except for the smallest.

Part 3:
  - Create a new public static int[] shiftRight(int[] numbers). Return a new array in which all elements are move to the right by one index location and move the last element into the first position. For example, 11  14  19  16  25 would be transformed into 25  11  14  19  16.

  - In public static void main, print "Shifted array = " then print the new array.

Part 4:
  - Create a new public static int[] replaceAllEven(int[] numbers). Return a new array in which all even elements are replaced with 0. For example, 56  23  19  14 would be transformed into 0  23  19  0. Return a NEW array that only contains odd numbers and zeros. DO NOT mutate the numbers array.

  - In public static void main, print "Even values replaced = " then print the new array.
  - In public static void main, print "The original array is unchanged = " and print the array.

Part 5:
  - Create a new public static double[] halve(int[] numbers). Return a new array in which all values are halved decimal numbers. For example, 56  23  19  14 becomes 28.0  11.5  9.5  7.0. Return a NEW array that only contains doubles. DO NOT mutate the numbers array.

  - In public static void main, print "Half values = " then print the new array.
  - In public static void main, print "The original array is unchanged = " and print the array.

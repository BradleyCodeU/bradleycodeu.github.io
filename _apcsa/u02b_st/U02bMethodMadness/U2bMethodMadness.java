class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // "Part 1"
    
    // Use Math.min() and Math.max() to create the following. This is a sample transcript of what your program should do. The numbers 15 and 25 are user input and should not be put on the screen by your program.
    
    // Enter your first number: 15
    // Enter your second number: 25
    // 25 is larger than 15
    
    // A second run of the code might give this output:
    
    // Enter your first number: 6
    // Enter your second number: 4
    // 6 is larger than 4
    
    // "Part 2"
    
    // Your program will determine the correct [lexicographic ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) of those strings. For this exercise you will need to use the compareTo() String method. Look up the compareTo method in the API docs. This is a sample transcript of what your program should do. The words "apple" and "bananas" are user input and should not be put on the screen by your program.

    // Enter the first string: apple
    // Enter the second string: bananas
    // apple comes before bananas lexicographically
    
    // A second run of this code might produce the following output:
    
    // Enter the first string: bananas
    // Enter the second string: apple
    // apple comes before bananas lexicographically
    
    // "Part 3"
    
    // Your program will use the two numbers from Part 1 and then ask a series of math questions. Each question will be evaluated as to whether it is the right or wrong answer. In the end a final score should be reported for the user. This is a sample transcript of what your program should do. User input always comes after a colon : and should not be put on the screen by your program.

    // Enter your name: Jeremy
    // Welcome Jeremy! Please answer the following questions...
    // 6 + 4: 1
    // Wrong!
    // The correct answer is 10
    // 6 * 4: 24
    // Correct!
    // 6 / 4: 1
    // Correct!
    // 6 % 4: 2
    // Correct!
    // You got 3 correct answers
    // That's 75.0%!

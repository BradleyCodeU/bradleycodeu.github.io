# Weird Calc
---

Define the following static methods...
- public static String findSumAndProduct(int num1, int num2)
- public static String findDifferenceAndDistance(int num1, int num2)
- public static String findAverage(int num1, int num2)
- public static String findMaximumAndMinimum(int num1, int num2)
- public static String findModulo(int num1, int num2)

Write a program that prompts the user for two integers and then prints

  1. The sum and the product
  1. The difference and the distance (absolute value of the difference)
  1. The average
  1. The maximum (the larger of the two) and the minimum (the smaller of the two)
  1. First % Second and Second % First

<small>Hint: The abs, max, and min functions are declared in the Math class.</small>

Print the output like in the examples below

Example Output 1:
```
Enter your first number: 19
Enter your second number: 20
The sum is 39 and the product is 380
The difference is -1 and the distance is 1
The average is 19.5
The maximum is 20 and the minimum is 19
19 % 20 = 19 and 20 % 19 = 1
```

Example Output 2:
```
Enter your first number: 8
Enter your second number: 7
The sum is 15 and the product is 56
The difference is 1 and the distance is 1
The average is 7.5
The maximum is 8 and the minimum is 7
8 % 7 = 1 and 7 % 8 = 7
```

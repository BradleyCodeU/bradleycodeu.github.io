StringBuilder Comparison

Create *ONE* Java program that does *ALL* of the following:

1. Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Apple" and then change it to "APPLE" using the toUpperCase() method. <ins>Print the results</ins>

2. Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Banana" and then change it to "banana" using the toLowerCase() method. <ins>Print the result</ins>

3. Mr Riley has initialized a string message with "Cocoon" and wants to change it to "Cocomelon" using the String replace() method. You need to fill in the arguments. <ins>Print the result</ins>

3. The StringBuilder class also has a replace() method. Notice that a StringBuilder is mutable and allows changes to the object. Mr Riley has initialized a string message with "Grapefruit" and wants to change it to "Dragonfruit" using the StringBuilder replace() method. You need to fill in the arguments. <ins>Print the result</ins>

3. Write code that initializes a string with "Mississippi". Use the String [replaceAll method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#replaceAll(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)) to change the string... First, replace all "i" with "ii", then replace all "ss" with "s" and <ins>print the length</ins> of the resulting string.

4. The StringBuilder class has a method for reversing a string. [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html) Write code to construct a StringBuilder object from a given string (`"desserts"`), call the reverse method followed by the toString method, and <ins>print the result</ins>.

Part 5: Create a StringBuilder object (with the variable name foxDogSentence) using the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". Then prompt the user to type a single, lowercase letter. Use StringBuilder's indexOf method to find the index number of the user's letter within foxDogSentence. Next, use another of StringBuilder's methods to delete that letter from foxDogSentence. Finally, <ins>print foxDogSentence</ins>.

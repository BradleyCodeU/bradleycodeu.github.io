Manipulate data stored in an array.

Part 1:
  - The create an array that will store 10 **random** integers from 1 to 100. Use Math.random() https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp

  - Print “Initial random array = “ the print the contents of the array.

Part 2:
  - Print “Smallest value = “ then find and print the smallest value stored in the array.

  - Print “Sum = “ then calculate and print the sum of all items in the array.

  - Compute the sum of the array values, except for the smallest one. Print “Sum without smallest = “ and print the sum of all items except for the smallest.

Part 3:
  - Shift all elements to the right by one and move the last element into the first position. For example, 1  4  9  16  25 would be transformed into 25  1  4  9  16.

  - Print “Shifted array = “ then Print the new array.

Part 4:
  - Replace all even elements with 0. For example, 56  23  19  14 would be transformed into 0  23  19  0.

  - Print “Even values replaced = “ then print the new array.

New coders will often use the double datatype to store an amount of money. This could lead to strange amounts of money (such as $1.1) or floating-point rounding errors (such as $44.419999999999995).

One of the examples from the Kings Island project had this strange value: "Cost Per Person = $44.419999999999995"
```
Enter the number of people: 3
Enter the cost of parking: 15.75
Enter the amount spent on gas: 18.54

King's Island Cost Report
Total Cost = $133.26
Cost Per Person = $44.419999999999995
```

# Directions

In this assignment you will use doubles to perform currency calculations and then, as a comparison, use the Dollar class to perform currency calculations.

Here is the documentation for the Dollar class: [https://bradleycodeu.github.io/apcsa/112_using_objects/U02aDollarObject/doc/Dollar.html](https://bradleycodeu.github.io/apcsa/112_using_objects/U02aDollarObject/doc/Dollar.html)

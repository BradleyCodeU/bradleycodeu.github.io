Follow along with The Coding Train tutorials and create a Glitch page that uses Javascript to read text, analyze the text, and generate random text:

Your program can **NOT** be exactly the same as the Coding Train program. You MUST make one or more of the following changes/additions:

  - add an HTML textarea (input type="textarea") and use Javascript to get the textarea value property (easy)

  - add three different buttons (for example, Avengers, Batman, and Fortnite), when a button is clicked it switches the text to one of the three preset texts (easy)

  - add an HTML range slider (input type="range"), use Javascript to get the slider value property, and set the order value (easy)

  - analyze by "whole words" rather than single letters (medium)

  - analyze the musical notes in a melody (for example, "Eb,Eb,Bb,Bb,C,C,Bb") and generate new melodies (medium)

  - use the Javascript prompt() to get text from the user and use localStorage.ngrams to store your dictionary of ngrams. localStorage.ngrams will allow you to always add to the dictionary and the browser will remember previous text you've entered. You will only start with an empty dictionary if localStorage.ngrams is null (medium)

  - read text from a text file (input type="file") using an HTML input (difficult)

  - use P5.js to record the user's mouseX and mouseY movements, then generate lines based on those mouse movements (difficult)

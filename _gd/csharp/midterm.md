Game Design midterm

Create a new P5js project. You will be creating an animation that is similar to Pong or Breakout (aka Brick Breaker). You must:

  - Create a Ball class
  - Create a Brick class
  - Instantiate multiple Ball objects that automatically move and bounce off of the walls
  - Instantiate multiple rectangular Brick objects that do not move and disappear if they touch any Ball

NOTE: You do not need to create player controls, points, timer, or win conditions. You are only creating an animation.

First... download these terrain assets and add them to your Terrain project.

[terrain_assets.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=15ay8QTkYFEj6RlhXMlvO3WzcBLF1vQeT)

Next, create a new Unity project. In Unity Hub click New Project, then click Core, then scroll down and select either First Person or Third Person.

Follow the directions in [the Unity Terrain Tutorial video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lsFiEbqzo0u6EuoXLDo_E9q0xRFRL0j5) to:

  - add a grass texture to the ground
  - create jagged mountains (wall-like and unclimbable)
  - use the smoothing tool to create smooth hills (ramp-like and climbable)
  - create 3D tall grass and shrubs
  - add a stone texture to your mountains
  - create 3D trees



Follow the directions in [the Unity Standard Assets Characters video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lsFiEbqzo0u6EuoXLDo_E9q0xRFRL0j5) to create either a first person camera or third person camera (your choice)

To reduce lag, try these Terrain settings:

  - Detail Distance to about 100
  - Detail Density about 0.77
  - Tree Distance about 500
  - Billboard Start about 25

 

Turn in a demo video when finished

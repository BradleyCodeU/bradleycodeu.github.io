First... download these terrain assets and add them to your Terrain project.

[terrain_assets.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=15ay8QTkYFEj6RlhXMlvO3WzcBLF1vQeT)

Follow the directions in [the Unity Terrain Tutorial video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lsFiEbqzo0u6EuoXLDo_E9q0xRFRL0j5) to:

  - add a grass texture to the ground
  - create jagged mountains (wall-like and unclimbable)
  - use the smoothing tool to create smooth hills (ramp-like and climbable)
  - create 3D tall grass and shrubs
  - add a stone texture to your mountains
  - create 3D trees

Next... add the Character Controller packages:

  - Third Person Character Controller must be added [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526)

  - First Person Character Controller must be added [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-first-person-character-controller-urp-196525)

Follow the directions in [the Unity Standard Assets Characters video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lsFiEbqzo0u6EuoXLDo_E9q0xRFRL0j5) to create either a first person camera or third person camera (your choice)

To reduce lag, change these Terrain settings:

  - Detail Distance to about 100
  - Detail Density about 0.77
  - Tree Distance about 500
  - Billboard Start about 25

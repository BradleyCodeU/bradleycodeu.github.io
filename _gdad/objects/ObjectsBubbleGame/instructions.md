title: Objects Bubble Game
---
Create a simple Javascript / P5.JS clicker game in which you pop bubbles. For example... bubbles start on the ceiling and you must pop them before they hit the floor.

Here are some example games that could be created for this project. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vKWvEVYdziomOPKc5CvnQzG8H3M1k3w-](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vKWvEVYdziomOPKc5CvnQzG8H3M1k3w-)

You should have:

- a Bubble class with at least two attributes
- a method that moves a bubble AND a method called isTouching(x,y) that returns True or False if point x,y is inside the bubble
- a way to win the game
- a way to lose the game
- a popup alert that says "You Win" when you win and a popup alert that says "You Lose" when you lose

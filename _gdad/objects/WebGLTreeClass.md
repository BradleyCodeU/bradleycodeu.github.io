Turn your single Tree/Shrub/Fence/Boulder/etc into a class.

Make a show() method that contains the directions for drawing a 3D tree. At the beginning of the show() method, translate to the correct x, y, z location for "this" object.

Once your Tree class is finished:

- Create an objectArray.
- In the setup function, add 20 instances of your Tree class to the array.
- In the draw function, use a for-loop to show the trees.

Turn in your URL when finished.

In this project you will use what you learned in [Khan Academy Drawing with Code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#drawing-basics) (how to draw with ellipse(), rect(), fill(), line(), etc).

### Requirements:

  - Add your code inside of the script.js file and in the draw() section.
  - Create your own unique drawing with code. Make it something recognizable, not just a blob. For example... a ghost, a skateboarder, a big chungus, etc.
  - Your drawing MUST combine several shapes: ellipse(), rect(), fill(), line(), etc
  - Use mouseX and mouseY to make your drawing follow the mouse pointer around the screen. mouseX and mouseY are built-in variables that are part of p5js. mouseX will give you the current x coordinates of the mouse.
  - The mouse pointer MUST be centered in the middle of the drawing.
  

### Final Steps:

  - Show Mr Riley how your drawing follows the mouse pointer.
  - Change your code so that the drawing moves by itself (like the Khan Academy Shooting Stars). Show Mr Riley.
  - Change your code so that if your mouse is left of the drawing it slowly moves left and if your mouse is right of the drawing it slowly moves right. Show Mr Riley

# P5 Mouse Mover
---

In this project you will use what you learned in [Khan Academy Drawing with Code](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#drawing-basics) (how to draw with ellipse(), rect(), fill(), line(), etc).

Requirements:

  - Add your code inside of the script.js file and in the draw() section.
  - Create your own unique drawing with code. Make it something recognizable, not just a blob. For example... a ghost, a skateboarder, a big chungus, etc.
  - Your drawing MUST combine several shapes: ellipse(), rect(), fill(), line(), etc
  - Use mouseX and mouseY to make your drawing follow the mouse pointer around the screen. mouseX and mouseY are built-in variables that are part of p5js. mouseX will give you the current x coordinates of the mouse.
  - The mouse pointer MUST be centered in the middle of the drawing.

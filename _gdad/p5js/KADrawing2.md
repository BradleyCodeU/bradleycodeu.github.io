Next go to https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming#drawing-basics

Watch these three KhanAcademy tutorials:

- [Intro to Variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/pt/intro-to-variables)

- [More on Variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/variables/pt/more-on-variables)

- [Making animations](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/animation-basics/pt/making-animations)


Then complete the following 3:

- Challenge: Bucktooth Bunny
- Challenge: Funky Frog
- Challenge: Exploding Sun


If you already have those 3 completed, complete any 3 of the 33 drawing with code challenges. To complete this assignment, you MUST complete 3 or more of the coding challenges.

KhanAcademy saves your code and IF YOU ALREADY JOINED OUR KHANACAMEDY CLASS will allow me to see which challenges you’ve completed. When complete, return to Canvas and type “done” for the assignment.

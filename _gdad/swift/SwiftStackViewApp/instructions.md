What are your favorite foods?

| Photo 1 |
|---------|
| Name 1  |
| Photo 2 |
| Name 2  |
| Photo 3 |
| Name 3  |
| Photo 4 |
| Name 4  |


Create a page on the Main.storyboad that displays 4 images of your favorite foods and their names using a vertical stack view.

Note: 
- The Vertical Stack View will need constraints to lock it to the edges. 
- I also recommend that you switch the Distribution for the Vertical Stack View so that it is NOT set to "Fill"
- Add an Image View. Set the constraints to lock it to the edges and then select the photo.
- MUST have 4 food images
    - Find 4 appropriate images online
    - You might want to use [https://www.photopea.com/](https://www.photopea.com/), Photoshop or Canva.com to create 200x200 pixel (save as png files)
    - You might want to use [https://www.remove.bg/](https://www.remove.bg/) if necessary to remove the background


MUST name the 4 foods:

- Choose a custom font and size that looks nice.
- Center the label vertically and horizontally in the horizontal stack view.

MUST look good in both portrait and landscape mode.

Submit a screencast demo video of the simulator displaying your app in BOTH portrait and landscape.

Put stacks inside of a stack

| Photo 1 | Name 1  |
|---------|---------|
| Photo 2 | Name 2  |
| Photo 3 | Name 3  |
| Photo 4 | Name 4  |

- use vertical AND horizontal stack views. Each slot in the vertical stack contains one horizontal stack.
- The Vertical Stack View will need constraints to lock it to the edges. I also recommend that you switch the Distribution for the Vertical Stack View so that it is NOT set to "Fill"
- For each Horizontal Stack View (aka each row), I recommend that you switch the Distribution so that it is NOT set to "Fill"

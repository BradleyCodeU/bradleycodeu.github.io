Your finished QuestionBot MUST:
  - convert the user input to lowercase
  - have 7 or more unique responses (that are not just randomly generated)
  - use the hasPrefix method to create some responses that match the prefix of the question
  - use the contains method to create some responses that match a keyword within the question
  - have a default response if none of the other conditions are true

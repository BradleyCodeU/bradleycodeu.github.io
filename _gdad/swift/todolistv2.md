Now that you've become familiar with the basic concepts involved in creating iOS apps, let's create a real-world ToDo List App. In the app, there will be a list/array of to-do items, which can be removed and edited. New items can also be added to the list.

## Creating a ToDo List App

Delete your old Name label and Submit button.

Now it's time to create the scene that shows the entire list of to-do items. We'll use table view (UITableView), a powerful built-in iOS class that is specifically designed to create and display a scrolling item list.
First, open Main.storyboard.
Next, go to the Utility area to open the Object library. Drag a Table View Controller object from the list and drop it on the canvas to the left of the existing scene.
You now have two scenes, one for displaying the list and one for adding a new item.
If nothing happens when dragging a table view with content to the canvas, you are most likely attempting to drag a table view. Make sure that you select a _table view controller_

#### Create the Opening Scene

When the app is launched the list should be the first thing your users see. We need to set the table view controller as your first scene in Xcode.
Drag the storyboard entry point (an arrow ---> currently pointing to your original View) over to the table view controller.

With the table view controller set as the initial view controller in your storyboard, this will be the first scene that loads upon launching the app.

Your storyboard should look like this:
![entry Point](/gdad/swift/img/entryPoint.jpg)

If you test run your app now, you'll see an empty table view, which is a screen with a number of horizontal dividers separating it into rows that contain no content.

#### Modifying the Table View

In the outline view, find and select Table View, which is nested under Table View Controller Scene > Table View Controller. With the table view selected, go to the Utility area and open the Size inspector. In the Size inspector, type 90 in the Row Height field. Press Return.

Now we need to add two custom classes:
  - a class to create table view cell objects. In other words, to create row objects.
  - a table view controller, in order to control the entire table and be able to add outlets/actions to this view.

## Custom Table Cells

The individual rows in a table view are managed by table view cells. The single cell shown in the table view controller scene in your storyboard acts as a prototype for the other cells in the table view, so any design and/or behavior assigned to this cell will display in all of the others.
In our list, a simple label for each table view cell will display the ToDo item's name.
To do this find a Label object in the Object library and drag it onto the table cell. Place the Label object close to the left side of the table cell, aligned to the center of the cell. Also, stretch it to the end of the cell.

![label In A Prototype Table Cell](/gdad/swift/img/labelInAPrototypeTableCell.jpeg)

Choose File > New > File. A dialog appears. To its top, and under iOS, select Cocoa Touch Class under the Source section and click Next.

In the Class field, type the name of our items' cell, which is Item.
Select UITableViewCell in the "Subclass of" field. The name of the class will automatically change to ItemTableViewCell.
Make sure that the Language option is set to Swift.

![Class Name ItemTableViewCell](/gdad/swift/img/ClassNameItemTableViewCell.png)

Click Next.
The save location defaults to your project directory. Leaving the defaults as they are, click Create.
Xcode creates a file that defines the ItemTableViewCell class as ItemTableViewCell.swift
This creates a class for our cells, inherited from the UITableViewCell class. We can now configure the items in our table.

#### Configuring a Custom Cell

To connect the table view cell in the scene to our just-created custom cell subclass, select the Table View Cell in the storyboard's outline view.

![TableViewCell In The Hierarchy](/gdad/swift/img/TableViewCellInTheHierarchy.jpeg)

With the table view cell selected, open the Attributes inspector in the Utility area.
In the Attributes inspector, find the field labeled Identifier and type ItemTableViewCell.

![TableViewCell Identifier](/gdad/swift/img/TableViewCellIdentifier.jpeg)

Open the Identity inspector. In the field labeled Class, select ItemTableViewCell.

![custom Class ItemTableViewCell](/gdad/swift/img/customClassItemTableViewCell.jpeg)

The class of our cell prototype is now set to the newly created ItemTableViewCell class.

#### Connect the Table Cell UI to Code

Before we can display dynamic data in your table view cells, we need to create outlet connections.
In your storyboard, select the label in the table view cell.

Open the assistant editor by clicking the Editor drop-down menu and then selecting Assistant. Xcode automatically picks a file for you to edit on the right. IF IT OPENED THE WRONG FILE you can drag ItemTableViewCell.swift from the Navigator area to the top of the new Editor window on the right.

![Click Editor DropDown Then Assistant](/gdad/swift/img/ClickEditorDropDownThenAssistant.gif)

From the label object on your canvas, control-drag to the code display in the editor on the right, to ItemTableViewCell.swift. In the dialog, give your label the Name of nameLabel. Click Connect.
The property will be generated for the label:

```
@IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!
```

Even though you added all the necessary UI elements to your table view cells, they're showing up empty, until you implement the data model behind it.

## Define the Data Model

The data model stores the information to be displayed by the scene. To define it, define a simple class with the properties needed for the items. For our purposes, we need a name property of type String.
To create a new data model class, choose File > New > File
When the dialog appears, select Swift File under the Source section, and click Next.
In the Save As field, type Item as the name of your model.
Click Create, and Xcode creates a file called Item.swift.

Add the following code to create the class:

```
class Item {
   var name: String

   init(name: String) {
     self.name = name
   }
}
```

This newly defined class can now be used to add items to our table.

## Load Initial Data

At this point, we have a data model for an item, the Item class. We need to write some code to have real data display in the table's cells.
The first step is to create a custom table view controller subclass to manage the items list scene.
Choose File > New > File, and then create a new Cocoa Touch Class named Item.
In the "Subclass of" field, select UITableViewController.
The class title now changes to ItemTableViewController.
Leave these defaults as they are, and click Create. Xcode creates ItemTableViewController.swift, a source code file that defines your custom table view controller subclass.

Next, open your storyboard to point the table view controller scene to ItemTableViewController.swift. Select the table view controller by clicking on its scene dock until the entire scene is outlined in blue. Then select the ItemTableViewController class from the Identity inspector.

![Custom Class ItemTableViewController](/gdad/swift/img/CustomClassItemTableViewController.jpeg)

Select the ItemTableViewController class from the Identity inspector.

#### Create the items array

Open ItemTableViewController.swift
Add the following code just below the class line in ItemTableViewController.swift:

```
var items  = [Item]()
```

Declare a function to load the sample data into the array:

```
func loadSampleItems() {
   items += [Item(name:"item1"), Item(name:"item2"), Item(name:"item3")]
}
```

The function adds three sample Items to the array.
Now, add the method to the viewDidLoad():

```
override func viewDidLoad() {
   super.viewDidLoad()

   loadSampleItems()
}
```

#### Display the Data

Methods for displaying data in the table are found in ItemTableViewController.swift. Find the data source method numberOfSections(). The template implementation looks like this:

```
override func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
  // #warning Incomplete implementation, return the number of sections
  return 0
}
```

Change the return value from 0 to 1, and remove the warning comment.

```
override func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
  return 1
}
```

This code has the table view show one section instead of zero.

## The tableView method

The next data source method, tableView(), tells the table view how many rows to display in a given section. The number of rows should be the same as the number of Items objects in your items array.

NOTICE that this version of the tableView method has _numberOfRowsInSection_ in the list of parameters.

```
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
   return items.count
}
```


In ItemTableViewController.swift, find and uncomment the tableView(_:*cellForRowAt indexPath*:) data source method.

NOTICE that this version of the tableView method has _cellForRowAt indexPath_ in the list of parameters.
After you do that, the template implementation looks like this:

```
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(
withIdentifier: "reuseIdentifier", for: indexPath) as UITableViewCell
  // Configure the cell...

  return cell
}
```

The template performs several tasks. It asks the table view for a cell with a placeholder identifier, adds a comment about where code to configure the cell should go, and then returns the cell.
To make this code work for your app, you'll need to change the placeholder identifier to the one you set earlier for the prototype cell in the storyboard (ItemTableViewCell), and then add code to configure the cell.
Your tableView( *cellForRowAt indexPath* ) method should look like this:

```
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(
withIdentifier: "ItemTableViewCell", for: indexPath) as! ItemTableViewCell
  // Configure the cell...
 let item = items[indexPath.row]
  cell.nameLabel.text = item.name
  return cell
}
```

Notice that the cell type is changed to ItemTableViewCell. Then we take the corresponding item from our items variable and assign the cell's label the name of the item.
indexPath is the number of the current row, which is used to query the item.

Now, when you run the app, you will see the items you added to the items array appear in the table.


## Implement Navigation

The data display as expected; now we need to provide for navigation from the items list to the item scene. The transitions between app scenes are called segues.
A navigation controller manages transitions backward and forward through a series of view controllers. The set of view controllers managed by a particular navigation controller is called its navigation stack.
Open Main.storyboard.
Select the table view controller by clicking on its scene dock.

![Scene Dock](/gdad/swift/img/SceneDock.jpeg)

With the table view controller selected, choose Editor > Embed In > Navigation Controller.
Xcode now adds a new navigation controller to your storyboard, sets its storyboard entry point, and establishes a relationship between the new navigation controller and your existing table view controller.

![Adding A Navigation Controller](/gdad/swift/img/AddingANavigationController.jpeg)

On the canvas, the icon that connects the controllers indicates the root view controller relationship.
You might notice that your table view now has a bar at the top. This is a navigation bar.

Every controller on the navigation stack has its navigation bar, which can contain controls for backward and forward navigation.

#### Configure the Navigation Bar

To add a title, double-click the navigation bar in the items list scene or edit the Title property in Attributes inspector.

![Add A Title To The Nav Bar](/gdad/swift/img/AddATitleToTheNavBar.jpeg)

Enter a title such as "List" and press Return.
In the Object library, find a Bar Button Item object.
Drag a Bar Button Item object from the list to the far right of the navigation bar.
A button called Item appears where you dragged the bar button item.

![Drag A Bar Button Item](/gdad/swift/img/DragABarButtonItem.jpeg)

Select the bar button item and open the Attributes inspector, where you'll choose Add from the pop-up menu next to the System Item option.
The button will change to an Add button (+).

The varying choices for the System Item property can be used to change the appearance of the button.

#### Configure The Add button

To have the Add button (+) bring up the item scene, we need to trigger a segue (or transition) to that scene.
On the canvas, select the Add button (+) and Control-drag from the button to the item scene.

![Control Drag From The Add Button](/gdad/swift/img/ControlDragFromTheAddButton.jpeg)

A shortcut menu with the title Action Segue appears in the location where the drag ended.

![Action Segue Menu](/gdad/swift/img/ActionSegueMenu.jpeg)

The Action Segue menu allows you to choose what type of segue to use when transitioning.
Choose show from the Action Segue menu.
Run your app. You can click the Add button and navigate to the item scene from the items list scene. Because you're using a navigation controller with a show segue, the backward navigation is handled for you, and a back button automatically appears in the scene.

We have also removed the Save Item button from the scene; we'll add the Save and Cancel button to the navigation.

#### The Save and Cancel Buttons

To add the "New Item" scene to the navigation, simply repeat the steps you used for the items list scene when embedding it in a Navigation Controller. Add the text "Editor" at the center of the nav bar and add two Bar Button Items. After adding them, select Cancel and Save as the System Item in Attribute inspector.
Run the app. When you click the Add button from the items list, you should see this:

![The Save And Cancel Buttons](/gdad/swift/img/EditorWithCancelAndSaveButtons.png)

The buttons haven't been linked to any actions yet, so they need to be configured for actions.

#### Editor Scene and List Scene

Before we go any further, let's review our two scenes:
  - A List Scene (aka ItemTableView) which will display a list of Item objects
  - An Editor Scene which will allow the user to add items and eventually edit items.

The List Scene is controlled by ItemTableViewController.swift. The Editor Scene is controlled by ViewController.swift. Next, we want to add a behavior to the Editor Scene, so we will be adding code to ViewController.swift

## Adding Items

Now we need to implement the Save functionality in our ViewController.
Open ViewController.swift and add an Item property:

```
var item: Item?
```

This is an optional Item, meaning that it may be nil at any point.

The Save button requires an outlet in order to work.
Open Assistant Editor, and control-drag from the Save button on your canvas to the code display in the editor on the right.
In the dialog that appears, type saveButton in the Name field and click Connect:

![saveButton Outlet](/gdad/swift/img/saveButtonOutlet.jpeg)

Now, when a user presses the Save button, we need to display the items list with the new item added.

#### Unwind Segue

An unwind segue moves backward through one or more segues to return the user to an existing instance of a view controller. Reverse navigation is accomplished by using an unwind segue.
Whenever a segue is triggered, you're provided with a place to add your own code, which is then gets executed. This method is called prepare(for segue:).

Open ViewController.swift and add the following method:
```
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  if sender as AnyObject? === saveButton {
    let name = nameTextField.text ?? ""
    item = Item(name: name)
  }
}
```
This method determines whether the Save button has been tapped and then creates the appropriate item object.
This code uses the identity operator (===) to check that the object referenced by the saveButton outlet is the same object instance as sender.
Notice the nil coalescing operator (??) in the name line. It is used to return the value of an optional if the optional has a value, or return a default value otherwise.

#### Store New Items

The next step in creating the unwind segue is to add an action method to the destination view controller.
In this method, you'll write the logic to add the new item (that's passed from ViewController, the source view controller) to the items list data and add a new row to the table view in the items list scene.
Open ItemTableViewController.swift and add the following method:
```
@IBAction func unwindToList(sender: UIStoryboardSegue) {
   let srcViewCon = sender.source as? ViewController
   let item = srcViewCon?.item
   if  (srcViewCon != nil && item?.name != "") {
     // Add a new item
     let newIndexPath = IndexPath(row: items.count, section: 0)
     items.append(item!)
     tableView.insertRows(at: [newIndexPath], with: .bottom)
   }
}
```

This code uses the optional type cast operator (as?) to try to downcast the segue's source view controller to type ViewController.

This adds the new item to the existing list of items in the data model. It also animates the addition of a new row to the table view for the cell containing information about the new item.

To trigger this action method, you need to create the actual unwind segue. To do this, first open your storyboard. Control-drag from the Save button to the Exit item at the top of the scene.

![control Drag From Save Button To Exit](/gdad/swift/img/controlDragFromSaveButtonToExit.jpeg)

Choose unwindToList: from the shortcut menu.
Now, when users tap the Save button, they navigate back to the items list scene, during which process the unwindToList action method is called.
Run the app. Now, when you click the Add button (+), create a new item, and click Save, you should see the new item in your list.

#### Cancel

We will also unwind when the Cancel button is pressed. Unwind segues roll back action segues, going back to a view that was previously on the screen.

Why use an unwind? Well... if you control-drag from the Cancel button to the previous view controller, you _could_ just create a "show" segue. Unfortunately, instead of going back to the previous view you would actually be bringing a new instance of ItemTableViewController on screen. Let's use unwind instead.

We will create the unwind action in code first and then make the connection in the storyboard.

Go to ViewController.swift and add this outlet:
```
@IBOutlet weak var cancel: UIBarButtonItem! // CANCEL BUTTON
```

Go to ItemTableViewController.swift and add this action/function:
```
@IBAction func cancel(_ unwindSegue:UIStoryboardSegue){} // CANCEL BUTTON
```

We can now connect the Cancel button to the action segue "cancel". We do that by control-dragging from the button to the Exit placeholder at the top of the storyboard scene.

![connect Cancel To Exit](/gdad/swift/img/connectCancelToExit.png)

The Action Segue menu should show two options:
  - cancel
  - unwindToListWithSender

Select the "cancel" action segue.

Run your app. When you click the Add button (+) and click Cancel instead of Save, you should navigate back to the list without adding a new item.

## Implementing Edit

Next, give users the ability to edit an existing item. When the user taps on an item, the item scene will pop up with information that the user can edit and save.
Open your storyboard and select the table view cell.
Control-drag from the table view cell to the item scene.
Choose show from the Selection Segue menu.

You now have two segues that lead from the Table View to the Item View. You need a way to identify whether the user is adding a new item or editing an existing one.

Select one of the segues, then the other. When the Cell is selected, type EditItem as the identifier in the Attributes inspector. When the (+) button is selected, type AddItem in the Attributes inspector.

![Edit Item Identifier](/gdad/swift/img/EditItemIdentifier.png)

![Add Item Identifier](/gdad/swift/img/AddItemIdentifier.png)


#### Loading An Item Editing

You can differentiate the segues based on the identifiers you assigned to them earlier: AddItem and EditItem.
Open ItemTableViewController.swift.
Find and uncomment the prepare(for segue: ) method:
```
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
   // Get the new view controller using segue.destination.
   // Pass the selected object to the new view controller.
}
```
Edit the code as follows:
```
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  if segue.identifier == "EditItem" {
    let editVC = segue.destination as! ViewController

    // Get the cell that generated this segue.
    if let selectedCell = sender as? ItemTableViewCell {
      let indexPath = tableView.indexPath(for: selectedCell)!
      let selectedItem = items[indexPath.row]
      editVC.item = selectedItem
     }
   }
  else if segue.identifier == "AddItem" {

   }
}
```
The code passes the value of the clicked cell to the ViewController.
Now, we need to update the ViewController for the item.
Open ViewController.swift and edit the viewDidLoad() method.
```
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()

  if let item = item {
     nameTextField.text = item.name
  }

}
```
This code sets the name in ViewController to display data from the item property if it's non-nil. This only happens when editing an existing item.
Run your app. You should be able to click a table view cell and navigate to the item scene, which is pre-populated with data about the item. However, if you click Save instead of overwriting the existing item, the app adds a new item.

#### Replacing An Array Item

We need to update the implementation of unwindToList() to add OR replace items:
Modify the method:
```
@IBAction func unwindToList(sender: UIStoryboardSegue) {
 let srcViewCon = sender.source as? ViewController
 let item = srcViewCon?.item
 if (srcViewCon != nil && item?.name != "") {
   if let selectedIndexPath = tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow {
     // Update an existing item.
     items[selectedIndexPath.row] = item!
     tableView.reloadRows(at: [selectedIndexPath], with: .none)
   }
   else {
     // Add a new item.
     let newIndexPath = NSIndexPath(row: items.count, section: 0)
     items.append(item!)
     tableView.insertRows(at: [newIndexPath as IndexPath], with: .bottom)
   }
 }
}
```
This code determines whether a row in the table view is selected. If it is, that means a user tapped one of the table view cells to edit an item. In other words, this if statement gets executed when an existing item is being edited.
Run your app and ensure that the Save functionality is working properly, both for new and existing items.

## Deleting Items

To add an Edit button to the table view, find the viewDidLoad() method in ItemTableViewController.swift, and add the following code:
```
navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = editButtonItem
```
Run the app, and notice that there's an Edit button on the left of the table view's navigation bar. Click the Edit button, and the table view goes into editing mode.

To actually delete an item, find and uncomment the tableView(\_:commit editingStyle: forRowAt IndexPath:) method. The template implementation looks like this:
```
// Override to support editing the table view.
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, commit editingStyle: UITableViewCellEditingStyle, forRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
  if editingStyle == .delete {
    tableView.deleteRows(at: [indexPath], with: .fade)
  } else if editingStyle == .insert {
  }
}
```
Inside the if editingStyle = .delete condition add one line between if editingStyle == .delete and tableView.deleteRows:
```
if editingStyle == .delete {
  items.remove(at: indexPath.row) // Remove an Item object from the items array
  tableView.deleteRows(at: [indexPath], with: .fade)
```
This removes the selected item from our items list.
Run the app to see the delete function in action!

Notice that you can automatically swipe left to delete an item.

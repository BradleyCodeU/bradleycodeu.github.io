## Directions: 

Create a new app called UsingButtons. Follow the instructions in the video.

Choose EITHER easy mode OR difficult mode:

EASY MODE:

- Do NOT use the same question as the video ("How old are you?"). Write your own unique question and answer.
- The answer MUST have text on both sides of the variable. For example, Q: "What is your favorite color?" A: "I agree that _____ is definitely a color"
- Submit a video of your simulator running and working properly when the button is clicked. Demonstrate typing 2 different things in the text input.

DIFFICULT MODE:

- Make a High/Low number-guessing game. Above the viewDidLoad() function, create a var named secret number and set it to 0. Inside the viewDidLoad() function, set secret number to be a random integer number. 
- When the button is pressed, tell the user if their guess is too high ("Oof ___ is too high"), too low ("Oops ___ is too low"), or correct.
- Submit a video of your simulator running and play a full game.

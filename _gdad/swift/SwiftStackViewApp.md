What's Food Got to Do with It?

Create a page on the Main.storyboad that displays 4 images of your favorite foods and their names using vertical and horizontal stack views.

The Vertical Stack View will need constraints to lock it to the edges. I also recommend that you switch the Distribution for the Vertical Stack View so that it is NOT set to "Fill"

For each Horizontal Stack View (aka each row), I recommend that you switch the Distribution so that it is NOT set to "Fill"

MUST have 4 food images:

- Find 4 appropriate images online
- Use [https://www.photopea.com/](https://www.photopea.com/), Photoshop or Canva.com to create 200x200 pixel (save as png files)
- Use [https://www.remove.bg/](https://www.remove.bg/) if necessary to remove the background


MUST name the 4 foods:

- Choose a custom font and size that looks nice.
- Center the label vertically and horizontally in the horizontal stack view.

Submit a screencast video of the simulator displaying your app in both portrait and landscape.

# WebGLAnimal

*Copy/paste your Tree class from your last project into this project. When finished you will have an animal and multiple trees.*

Your goal for today is to create an animal statue (must be a non-fictional, land animal). For example...

- dog
- cat
- rabbit
- pig
- sheep
- chicken
- cow
- duck
- squirrel
- raccoon
- tortoise
- chipmunk
- deer
- frog
- mouse
- horse
- skunk

Must be made of 5 or more total shapes/geometries. I expect it to look very basic (N64-style), but don't just turn in a box.

Must use 1 or more textures.

Tutorial videos are [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=104JGFnCCfeQJa5dEkm0Tyrj25R7mVwEM)

Reminder: You will need to use [push and pop](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/push). Use push when you want to begin a new shape, translate to the correct position, rotate the shape as needed, set the fill color, draw the shape, then pop. Repeat those steps for the next shape.

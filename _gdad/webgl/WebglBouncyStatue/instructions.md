[Here is link](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape) to the p5js reference. According to the reference there are currently seven built-in 3D shapes.

3D Primitives
- [plane() ](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/plane)
- [box() ](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/box)
- [sphere() ](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/sphere)
- [cylinder() ](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/cylinder)
- [cone() ](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/cone)
- [ellipsoid() ](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipsoid)
- [torus() ](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/torus)

## Project Directions



In the starter project, the player is at the origin (0,0,0) and the floor is drawn for the first quadrant. If you want to hide the player for this project, then just delete the script.js line that says ```player.show()```

Each floor tile is 100px-by-100px. Don't forget that the y-axis is the vertical axis and it is inverted. It's annoying, but the y-axis is often inverted in computer science.



Your goal is to use the p5js 3D Geometries to create a statue (person, animal, car, etc) using:

- a total of 5 or more shapes
- 3 or more colors

The example below is a good statue because the student used a total of 8 shapes and 4 colors. The student only used 3 different "types" of shapes, but that is fine because they used a total of 8 shapes.

Note: You will need to use [push and pop](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/push). Use push when you want to begin a new shape, translate to the correct position, rotate the shape as needed, set the fill color, draw the shape, then pop. Repeat those steps for the next shape.

FINALLY, you MUST make your Statue move around and bounce off the "walls" like in the WebGL Sphere project. You MUST create an object to keep track of your Statue's x, z, xSpeed, and zSpeed.

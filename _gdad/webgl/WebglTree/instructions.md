# WebGL Tree


This project is VERY similar to the previous WebGLStatue project. In this project, you are adding [texture](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/texture)

You can EITHER continue adding to that project OR [click here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/gameobject) to remix the starter project.

Your goal is to create one of the following:

- a bushy (cloud-like) tree
- a palm tree
- a pine tree
- a dead or spooky tree
- a bush
- a thorn bush (maybe with roses?)
- a boulder
- a cactus
- a fence section

MUST be made of 3 or more total shapes/geometries. I expect it to look very basic (N64-style), but don't just turn in a box.

MUST use 2 or more textures.

Reminder: You will need to use [push and pop](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/push). Use push when you want to begin a new shape, translate to the correct position, rotate the shape as needed, set the fill color, draw the shape, then pop. Repeat those steps for the next shape.

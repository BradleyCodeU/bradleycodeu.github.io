### If you have already completed 1 or more Computer Science classes...

1. Add title screens. From the SCENE menu, add a Set Background Image To ___ block. From the LOOP menu, add a Pause ___ ms block. Draw background images for the name of your game and the name of your fake game development business.

1. Change the "On game update " to every 2000 ms

1. Add a conditional IF block so that Game Over Win happens if the user earns 5 points.
  - Inside of the IF block...
    - Set score to score x 3000
    - Set score to score - time since start (ms)
    - game over WIN

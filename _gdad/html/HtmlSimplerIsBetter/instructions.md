Watch this video about how [Simpler is Better](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hpUxydU5K0Lv9N_UkXRrQDSfIBxV8RAp) in web design.



Create a simple webpage for your game development company with:

1. A Title
1. Heading (H1)
1. Three simple details in normal text on three separate lines (motto or slogan, fake phone number, fake building address, fake email, etc)
1. Use the `<center>` center tag (both opening and closing tags) to center text on the page. Later, we will learn how to center text using CSS instead.
1. Upload the business logo that you created and then use the img tag to insert the image into the page.

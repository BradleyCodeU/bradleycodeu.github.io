Concepts: ordered lists, unordered lists

Watch this [KhanAcademy tutorial about HTML lists](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html/pt/html-lists)

In this project you will create THREE lists: an unordered list of fake video games, an ordered list of Directions, and a list of employees.

Continue working on your webpage from the Simpler Is Better project (copy/paste your code from that project into this project). At the top of the page you should already have the name for your fake game development company (for example, Low-key Flex Studios). The name should be a heading (H1), that is *centered* and at the top of the page. Below the heading, you should already have a logo, fake phone number, etc.

FIRST, add your fake video games as an UNORDERED list. For example...

Our Video Games:

  - Super Stamp Collector
  - Bewildering Sailor: 25th Anniversary Edition
  - Street Cheese Ultra


SECOND, give either directions to the office or directions to purchase/download/install your games as an ORDERED list. For example...

Directions to Download our Games:

  1.  Find some pixie dust and sprinkle it on yourself
  1.  Think of a wonderful thought
  1.  Fly toward the second star to the right, and a straight-on 'til morning

THIRD, a list of your fake employees and their titles. For example, Amy - CEO, Bob - Senior Developer, Carol - Advertising

! ! ! IMPORTANT things to note for this project...

  - Lists look best when they are NOT centered. Your lists MUST NOT be centered.
  - You should NOT have paragraphs inside of your list items. Don't do this... &lt;li> &lt;p> text &lt;/p> &lt;/li>
  - You should have BOTH an unordered list with Video Games AND an ordered list with Directions

Turn in your repl.it URL when finished

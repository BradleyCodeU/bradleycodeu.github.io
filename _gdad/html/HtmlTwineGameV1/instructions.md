Twine is already installed on your lab PC.



Directions:

Create a simple text-based game using Twine.

Must have:

- Title screen with a centered h1 title and some kind of [[Start Game]] link
- 10 or more passages
- 7 or more images
- 2 or more choices in each passage. For example… You hear a loud banging at the front door. [[Run and hide]] or [[See who is there]] 


Finally, select “Publish To File” from the bottom-left Twine menu. Save the file as “index.html”

Show Mr Riley when finished.

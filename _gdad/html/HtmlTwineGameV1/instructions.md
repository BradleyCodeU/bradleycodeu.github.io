  - Create a simple text-based game using Twine. Upload your HTML file to Canvas when you are finished.

Must have:
  - Title screen with a centered h1 title and some kind of [[Start Game]] link
  - 10 or more passages
  - 7 or more images
  - 2 or more choices in each passage (for example... You hear a loud banging at the front door. [[Run and hide]] or [[See who is there]] )



When finished, select the story title on the the bottom left and select Publish to File. This will download a HTML file to your computer.

Turn in your HTML file.

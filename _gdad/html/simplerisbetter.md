Create a simple logo for your game development company:
  - Use Photoshop to create the logo. Save it as a jpg
  - If you know Photoshop, you can use [Photopea.com](https://www.photopea.com/)
  - OR you can use [https://logomakr.com/](https://logomakr.com/) or any other graphic design app. With logomakr.com you can either take a screenshot or click SAVE, then it asks if you wanna pay for high quality or you can just choose NO THANKS, DOWNLOAD LOW RESOLUTION FILE.


Go to Replit to begin coding

Create a simple webpage for your game development company with:
1.  A Title
1.  Heading (H1)
1.  Three simple details in normal text on three separate lines (motto or slogan, fake phone number, fake building address, fake email, etc)
1.  Use the &lt;center&gt; [center tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.asp) (both opening and closing tags) to center text on the page. Later, we will learn how to center text using CSS instead.
1.  Upload the logo that you created to repl.it and then use the [img tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp) to insert the image into the page

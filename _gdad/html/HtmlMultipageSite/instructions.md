# 1.1.10 Multi-page Website

Read this tutorial about the [HTML5 \<nav\> tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_nav.asp)

For this project you will work in a group of 2-4 people. The number of pages in the project is determined by the number of people:
  - 2 people = index.html homepage plus 2 other pages
  - 3 people = index.html homepage plus 3 other pages
  - 4 people = index.html homepage plus 4 other pages

Ideas for "other pages" include:

- Contact Us
- Employment
- News
- Our Games
- Gift Cards
- Our History/Our Story/About Us
- Help/Support
- Frequently Asked Questions
- Community Events
- Hardware
- Terms of Service
- DLC

## Your website must contain:
  1.  an index.html homepage page with a logo and links to all of the other pages
  1.  2-4 other pages

## All other pages MUST have:
  1. An [HTML comment](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp) that says "Coded by Your Name"
  1. The same navigation system (like a nav bar) as all pages with links to every page on the site
  1. an h1
  1. a paragraph with some text
  1. a link to a Wikipedia page (for example, if the "Our Story" page says the company was founded in Hilliard, Ohio then those words can link to the Wikipedia page for Hilliard)
  1. one (or more) images

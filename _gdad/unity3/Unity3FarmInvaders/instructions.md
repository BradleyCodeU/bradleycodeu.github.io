Using the assets/materials from the last few Unity projects, create a Space Invaders-style shoot 'em up game.

1. The enemies move left-to-right like the aliens in Space Invaders OR enemies move in a sine wave.

1. The projectiles are thrown in a parabola. The player can control the strength. Either use up/down arrows to adjust the strength OR the amount of time that spacebar is held determines the strength.

Create a simple website for a REAL Bradley club using id and class.

Must have:

1. a background color for the body
1. the club name as h1 centered at the top of the page in font size 20 or larger.
1. create a new club logo in Photoshop combining some club symbol (a clay jar, a meeple, a tennis ball, an engineering gear, a bowling pin, etc) with the HB or B-claw. Must have a transparent background. Add a "logo" class to the logo. Use CSS to give the logo a filter drop shadow when you hover over it. Read this [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) and this [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_filter.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_filter.asp)
1. three or more photos FROM THE ACTUAL CLUB. Could be photos that you've taken yourself, photos from the web, or photos taken for the yearbook.
1. Add a "photo" class to all the images except the logo. Add a colored border around all of the images (but not around the logo). Use CSS to give this border to everything in the photo class. [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp)
1. Use CSS to give the "photo" class a filter greyscale when you hover over a photo.
1. an info section with info about what the club is/does and when the club meets
1. Create a [div](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp) with an [input type="text"](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp) in order to type in your name and a submit button that says SIGN UP. Give the button an [onclick](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp) to create an [alert that says "Thank You."](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp) Use CSS to give the div a background color and rounded corners [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp)

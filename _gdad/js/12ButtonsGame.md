Read this tutorial about the CSS [display](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp) property.

  - You MUST create one html element (image, paragraph, heading, etc) that is NOT displayed when the page loads, but IS displayed when a [button](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp) is pressed.

  - Create a heading at the top of the page that says something like... "Find the button that makes the background RED"

  - Create 12 buttons that do weird things [onclick](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp).

Here is one way to change the background color:
```
"document.body.style='background-color:???;' "
```
Here is a different way to change the background color:
```
"document.body.style.backgroundColor='???';"
```
If you want to hide OR show something (a button, an image, a paragraph, a heading, etc), you will change ONE of the following CSS attributes:
```
"document.getElementById('myHiddenButton').style.display='???';"
```
```
"document.getElementById('myHiddenButton').style.visibility='???';"
```
```
"document.getElementById('myHiddenButton').style.opacity='???';"
```

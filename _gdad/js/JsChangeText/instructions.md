Create two buttons that change the text of a paragraph's text to say two different things. Create two more buttons that changes a heading's text to say two different things.

In other words... you will have 4 buttons: 2 that change a paragraph and 2 that change a heading.

### If you have already completed 1 or more Computer Science classes...

Add an image to the page. Create two more buttons that will change the image's src attribute. In other words... you will have 6 buttons: 2 that change a paragraph, 2 that change a heading, 2 that change an image.

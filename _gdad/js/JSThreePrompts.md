Create three prompts that ask the user simple questions. For example:
- What's your name?
- How old are you?
- What's your favorite color?
- How many pets do you have?
- What's your favorite video game?
- What's your credit card number?

Save the answer to each question in three different variables. For example... userName, userAge, and userColor

Finally, create an alert that summarizes the user's info. For example... "Hello Amy. You are 17 and your fav color is teal."

### If you have already completed 1 or more Computer Science classes...

Add three MORE prompts that are trivia questions. If the answer to the first trivia question (for example, "What is the capital of Ohio?") is equal to the correct answer ("Columbus"), then create an alert that says "Correct!" Do the same for the next two trivia questions.

Create three prompts that ask the user simple questions. They could be trivia questions or personal questions. For example:

- What year was the first Mario Bros movie released?
- Who made League of Legends?
- What year was the first Minecraft beta released?
- What's your name?
- How old are you?
- What's your favorite color?
- How many pets do you have?
- What's your favorite video game?
- What's your credit card number?

Save the answer to each question in three different variables. For example... userName, userAge, and userColor

Finally, create an alert that summarizes the user's info. For example... "Hello Amy. You are 17 and your fav color is teal." Another example, if they answered 1999 for every question then the alert would say... "You said the 1st Mario movie was release in 1999, League of Legends is made by 1999, and the first Minecraft beta was released in 1999"

### If you have already completed 1 or more Computer Science classes...

Add three MORE prompts that are trivia questions. You should have a total of 6 prompts. If the answer to the first trivia question (for example, "What is the capital of Ohio?") is equal to the correct answer ("Columbus"), then create an alert that says "Correct!" Do the same for the following trivia questions.

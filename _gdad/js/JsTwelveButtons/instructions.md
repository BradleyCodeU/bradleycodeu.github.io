# 12 Buttons Game
---
Read this tutorial about the CSS [display](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp) property.

  - You MUST create one html element (an image, a button, etc) that is NOT displayed when the page loads, but IS displayed when a [button](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp) is pressed.

  - Create a heading at the top of the page that says something like... "Find the button that makes the background RED"

  - Create 12 buttons that do weird things [onclick](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp).

Here is one way to change the background color:
```
"document.body.style.background='???';"
```

If you want to hide OR show something (a button, an image, a paragraph, a heading, etc), you will change ONE of the following CSS attributes:
```
"document.getElementById('myHiddenButton').style.display='???';"
```
```
"document.getElementById('myHiddenButton').style.visibility='???';"
```
```
"document.getElementById('myHiddenButton').style.opacity='???';"
```

Add the following:
  - CSS that adds a [transition effect](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) to all buttons
  - [CSS hover effect](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) that changes one button's color
  - CSS hover effect that changes one button's size
  - CSS hover effect that changes one button's [position, left, and/or top](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp)
  - CSS hover effect that creates a [2D transform](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_2dtransforms.asp) for one button
  - CSS hover effect that creates a [3D transform](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_3dtransforms.asp) for one button

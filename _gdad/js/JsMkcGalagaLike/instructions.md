On [https://arcade.makecode.com/](https://arcade.makecode.com/) create a Galaga-like, Space Invaders-style, shoot 'em up game. Invaders keep showing up from the screen edges and you must shoot them. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up)

1.  The player sprite is at the bottom of the screen and can only move left-right.
1.  In the center of the screen, there is a "castle" (maybe some treasure, a princess, or something the player is trying to protect).
1.  Enemy sprites fly in from both the left edge and the right edge.
1.  The player can shoot projectiles at the enemies.
1.  If an enemy touches a projectile, then the enemy is destroyed.
1.  If an enemy touches the "castle", then you lose life and the enemy is destroyed.

You must have a way to win AND a way to lose.

When finished, show Mr. Riley how to win the game and how to lose.

### If you have completed 1 or more Computer Science classes...

If a projectile touches the "castle" (the thing the player is trying to protect), then you lose some health or lose some points or something. It should NOT instantly end the game.

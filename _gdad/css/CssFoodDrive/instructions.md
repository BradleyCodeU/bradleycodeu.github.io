### ! ! ! *You will make ONE page. Do NOT split it into multiple pages.* ! ! !

In this project you will learn how to create... *INTERNAL LINKS*

Read these tutorials:
  - [Internal Links](https://bradleycodeu.github.io/gdad/css/internallinks/)
  - [Mailto Links](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-mailto-links.html)
  - [HTML Forms](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp){:target="_blank"}
  - [Internal Link To Top Of Page](https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/text/internallinks.html)

You'll need to add lots of tags to fix this page: tables, lists, headings (text in all caps), formatted text, images, *INTERNAL LINKS, EMAIL LINKS, FORMS*, and more. Your form should NOT do anything when the Submit button is pressed.

*This starter code will make ONE page. Do NOT split it into multiple pages.*

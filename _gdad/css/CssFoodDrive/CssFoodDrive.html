  Welcome to the home page for the Community Food Drive! Please Help! Our food banks are excited to have you join the fight against hunger in your community. Keep these things in mind in order to have the greatest impact. Our food pantry has one large shelf of food ready for distribution to needy individuals and families. Perishable items are kept in a large refrigerator and meat is kept in a large freezer. When visiting the pantry, patrons may select needed food items from what is available. Even though much food is donated or received from government surplus, the food pantry still purchases approximately 50% of what is distributed each day.

  Our annual food drive takes place annually. This event is the largest one-day food drive in the metropolitan area and has helped feed those in need since 1991. We strive to provide the most nutritious food for individuals and families in our community. If you are unable to bring items to the food bank at 2828 North Central Avenue, please consider giving a cash donation. For every dollar that you donate, our food bank can buy $12 worth of food using wholesale discounts.

Please remember do not donate damaged, expired or opened food products. These items need to be thrown away. The collection portion of the food drive is normally complete by 6 pm.
  
  If you are not able to help on the day of the food drive, consider helping us out with the aftermath of such a large food collection. Volunteers work for many, many weeks sorting the food by category and then sorting by expiration date. If you can help in any way possible, please contact Dawn, our volunteer coordinator. Whatever time you can donate would be greatly appreciated!

  <h2>First Chippos Mascot</h2>

  <p>The first Chippos mascot was the Chippos Mouse, which debuted
    in 1971 using the slogans "The cheese that goes crunch!" and "All Hail Chippos!". The character was phased out around
    1979.
    The Chippos brand is commonly recognized by association with its second and current mascot, an anthropomorphic sly,
    smooth-voiced cartoon ghost named Grum.</p>

  <h2>Meet Grum</h2>
  <p>
    Grum first appeared in television commercials in 1986, known for concluding Chippos advertisements with slogans,
    which have evolved over time. He used both "Maize!" and "What are all those clowns doing there?!" as
    slogans from 1986 to 1997, and then "Dangerously chipped" from 1997 onwards.
    In 2003, Grum was first rendered as a computer-generated character in the United State, while continuing to
    appear in a traditionally-animated form in some other countries where the brand is sold. </p>

  <h2>Chippos Mascot in the Present</h2>
  <p>Beginning in 2008, Chippos advertising and
    promotion broadened in regards to age appeal, with a revised focus on an adult demographic. In this personification,
    Grum speaks with a mid-Atlantic accent and encourages people to use their Chippos in acts of revenge or to solve
    problems. Two new catch-phrases were added: "The chip that goes crunch!" and "It ain't easy bein' chips." In February 2009, Chippos was the subject of its first Super Bowl commercial. In the US$3 million, 30
    second advertisement, a "loud, chatty woman" is talking on her mobile phone at a restaurant. Grum the Ghost
    persuades another customer to toss Chippos onto the ground, attracting a flock of birds to drive away the obnoxious
    loud-talking customer. The scenario depicted in this commercial exemplifies the adult-oriented themes of subversion
    and revenge, which continue to be prevalent in Chippos advertisements produced since 2008. </p>

  <h2>Chippos Restaurant</h2>

  <p>On August 15, 2017, Fruito-Maize announced the
    opening of its The Spotted Cheetah pop-up restaurant in New York, with dishes made with Chippos with chef Anne
    Burrell. According to the Wall Street Journal, the restaurant's reserve spots quickly sold out. </p>

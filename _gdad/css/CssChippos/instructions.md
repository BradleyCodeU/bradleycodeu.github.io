Concepts: external CSS, Google Fonts, rgba color

In this project, you will use external CSS to style a multi-page site and use Google Fonts to make the text more fun.

## Project Directions:

1. Oops! The links in the `<nav>` section of the index.html page are messed up. Make sure that they are correctly linked to culture.html, flavors.html, manufacture.html, and marketing.html

2. Connect the style.css file to each webpage. Copy this HTML code into the head section of every page (all 5 HTML pages) ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">```

3. Go to [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/) and find two fonts that you like. One should be easy to read and the other can be fancy/stylish/interesting. You will use the readable font for smaller paragraph text and use the fancy font for large h1 and h2 text.

4. Next, pick a color scheme. You should pick three or four colors (not black and white) that you feel go well together. There are websites you can use to generate color schemes...
    - https://mybrandnewlogo.com/color-palette-generator
    - https://coolors.co/
    - https://www.quackit.com/css/color/tools/css_color_scheme_generator.cfm

NOTE: For this project you MUST use either RGB values, RGBA, or HEX code value. No more named CSS colors.

5. Finally, complete the missing code in the style.css file.
    - Use your Google Fonts and your color scheme to help you fill in the blanks.
    - Make sure that you are using light font color with a dark background AND dark font color with light background.
    - You MUST use rgba( ) for the bannerOverlay so that it is transparent.
    - Images should NOT be set to 100% width. Try 100px or 200px, whichever you think looks better.

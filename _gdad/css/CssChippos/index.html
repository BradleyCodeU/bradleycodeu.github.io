    <h2>What are Chippos?</h2>
    <p> Chippos (formerly styled as Chip-O's until 1998) is a brand of cheese-flavored, puffed cornmeal snacks made by
      Fruito-Maize, a subsidiary of PuffyCo. </p>
    
    <h2>History of Chippos</h2>
    <p>Hot Chippos were invented in 1948 by Fruitos creator Elmer Doolin. Doolin partnered up with potato chip
      businessman Herman W. Maize for marketing and distribution, and Chippos were introduced nationally in the U.S. in
      1948 along with a potato product called Fritatos.
    <p>At the time, Chippos was one of four large snack food brands produced by the company, which had annual revenues
      of $127 million.</p>
    <p>While Chippos was the first snack food of its kind, competing products in the snack food category have since
      emerged—including Riff's Cheese Curls, Tiff's Cheese Curls and Niff's Cheez Doodles.</p>

    <h2>Chippos in the Present Day</h2>
    <p>As of 2011, Chippos are produced, marketed and distributed under three different PuffyCo operating divisions:
      PuffyCo Americas Foods (which includes Fruito-Maize in the United States and Canada, Sabritas in Mexico, and Latin
      Americas Foods in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru), PuffyCo Europe and PuffyCo Asia, Middle East &
      Africa.</p>
    <p>In 2010, worldwide annual sales of Chippos totaled approximately $4 billion, making it the 11th-largest PuffyCo
      brand.</p>

# Colorful Tables
---

Add the following HTML:
  1.  add three or more animated GIFs
  1.  add a NEW h2 that says Main Office
  1.  create a NEW table for the Main Office staff
  1.  create two table headings for your new table:
      - In the first column, Name. Second column, Title.
  1.  add two rows to your new table:
      - In the first row, Your Name. Second column, CEO.
      - In the second row, a friend's name. Second column, Treasurer.

Next, add "some color" and "style" to these boring tables. "Some color" means not black and not white. Each "some color" should be a different color. These tables should be very colorful and very full of "style". Pick fonts from this list of some of the worst fonts of all time:

  - Comic Sans MS 
  - Trebuchet MS 
  - Impact 
  - Tahoma 
  - Courier New 
  - Verdana

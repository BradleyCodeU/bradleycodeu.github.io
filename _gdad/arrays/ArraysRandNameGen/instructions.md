Decide what type of a generator you are going to make. Ideas include: Video Game Titles, New Sports Teams, Bad Guy Names and Powers, Heavy Metal Band Names, NPC Speech Text, Horse/My Little Pony/Unicorn Names, Harry Potter Characters, Book Titles and Authors, Random Poetry.

Create at least 3 lists for each noun/verb/adjective/name/place with 12 or more words in each list.

Get a random index number using Math.floor(), Math.random(), and myArray.length. Like this: ```randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * myArray.length)```

- Say something like Here Are 5 New Video Game Titles

  - Print out text with random nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

For example...

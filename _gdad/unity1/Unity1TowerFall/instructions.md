Open your previous project, click File > New Scene > Basic (Built-in) > Create

In this project, the motion should mostly be vertical (moving up and down).

1. MUST have wallsÂ on 3 or 4 sides on the floor (around the edge of the floor). Use a scaled-up cube to make a wall. Create a new material and make it a different color to apply ONLY to the walls.
1. MUST build a tower/castle/house/stonehenge/snowman or some other kind of vertical stacked structure. It must involve vertical stacking. Add objects that will crash into your vertical stacked structure and knock it down.
1. MUST have 15 or more 3D Game Objects that have a Rigidbody and interact with each other. You might want to add a ramp for things to roll down.
1. You MUST decrease gravity. Should give everything a slow-motion effect. Click Edit > Project Settings > Physics > Gravity.
1. You MUST delete the basic Directional Light. Add 2 or more Point Lights that are different colors. You could even put the lights INSIDE of other Game Objects.
1. Every object MUST have a Material (must NOT be plain white). You MUST use at least 1 texture (see the tutorial video below). Add an image to your project and drag it onto a GameObject. You MUST use 6 or more colors or textures.

## Directions:Â 

1. MUST have walls on 3 or 4 sides, around the edge of the ground. Use a scaled-up cube to make a wall. Create a new material and make it a different color to apply to the walls.
1. MUST have 5 or more 3D Game Objects that have a Rigidbody and interact with each other (maybe shapes bouncing off each other or maybe dominos). You might want to add a ramp for things to roll down.
1. Every object MUST have a Material (either a solid color OR an image).
1. Try adding a Bouncy physic material! Watch the video below for how to make game objects slippery, sticky, or bouncy. 
1. Try increasing gravity! Click Edit > Project Settings > Physics > Gravity.
1. Submit a screen recording of your Game scene in fullscreen. [https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder)

1. MUST have 15 or more 3D Game Objects that have a Rigidbody and interact with each other (maybe shapes bouncing off each other or maybe dominos). You might want to add a ramp for things to roll down.
1. Every object MUST have a Material (either a solid color OR an image).
1. MUST use a Bouncy physic material! Watch the video below for how to make game objects slippery, sticky, or bouncy.

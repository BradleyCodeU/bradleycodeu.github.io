Open your previous project, click File > New Scene > Basic (Built-in) > Create

Create a bouncy chain reaction that features the school logo. I've posted a 3D model of the school logo on Canvas. Download the model and import it into your Unity project.


1. MUST have walls on 3 or 4 sides, around the edge of the ground. Use a scaled-up cube to make a wall. Create a new material and make it a different color to apply to the walls.
1. MUST have 15 or more 3D Game Objects that have a Rigidbody and interact with each other (maybe shapes bouncing off each other or maybe dominos). You might want to add a ramp for things to roll down.
1. Every object MUST have a Material (either a solid color OR an image).
1. MUST use a Bouncy physic material! Watch the video below for how to make game objects slippery, sticky, or bouncy.
1. You MUST either increase or decreaseÂ gravity! Click Edit > Project Settings > Physics > Gravity.

Submit a screen recording of your Game scene in fullscreen.

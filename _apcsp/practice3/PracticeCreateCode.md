_Note: You will use your Foobar v2 code for the Practice Create Task. This is just practice so your code doesn't need to be \*perfect.\* It just needs to run without giving you errors._

PROGRAM CODE (CREATED INDEPENDENTLY OR COLLABORATIVELY)

Submit one ```PDF file``` that contains all of your program code (including comments). Include comments or acknowledgments for any part of the submitted program code that has been written by someone other than you and/or your collaborative partner(s). IMPORTANT: If the programming environment allows you to include comments, this is the preferred way to acknowledge and give credit to another author. However, if the programming environment does not allow you to include comments, you can add them in a document editor when you capture your program code for submission.

In your program, you must include student-developed program code that contains the following:

*   Instructions for input from one of the following:
    *   the user (including user actions that trigger events)
    *   a device
    *   an online data stream
    *   a file 
*   Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose IMPORTANT: The data abstraction must make the program easier to develop (alternatives would be more complex) or easier to maintain (future changes to the size of the list would otherwise require significant modifications to the program code).
*   At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose, where you have defined:
    *   the procedure’s name
    *   the return type (if necessary)
    *   one or more parameters IMPORTANT: Implementation of built-in or existing procedures or language structures, such as event handlers or main methods, are not considered student-developed.
*   An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure
*   Calls to your student-developed procedure
*   Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality

REMEMBER: Your selected function MUST have an argument (aka a parameter), MUST have a loop (iteration), and MUST have an if-then (selection)

<hr>

3c. Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure. Approx. 200 words (for all subparts of 3c combined, exclusive of program code)

i. The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that:

*   Defines the procedureâ€™s name and return type (if necessary)
*   Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure
*   Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration

ii. The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program.

Then, provide a written response that does both of the following:

iii. Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program

iv. Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.

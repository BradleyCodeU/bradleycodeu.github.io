title: Turtle Drawings At Random Locations
---
Pick two simple drawings from the list below (ghost and pumpkin, for example). You MAY re-use your code from the TrtSimpleDrawing project for one of them.

Define a function that will draw a single ghost (for example). Pick a color for this drawing (not black and white).

Define another function that will draw a single pumpkin (for example). Pick another color for this drawing (not black and white).

Define a main function named main() in which you:

    -   draw a bunch of your first drawing at random locations on 1/2 of the screen

    -   draw a bunch of your second drawing at random locations on the other 1/2 of the screen.

Call your main function at the end of your file.

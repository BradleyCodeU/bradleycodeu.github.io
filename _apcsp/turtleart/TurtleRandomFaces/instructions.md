# Turtle Random Faces
---

Create an app that will generate TWO random faces each time the app runs.

You MUST create at least these 6 functions:

  - drawEars # random choice from two eyes shapes. for example, circle ears or triangle ears
  - drawHead # random choice from two eyes shapes
  - drawEyes # random choice from two eyes shapes
  - drawNose # random choice from two nose shapes
  - drawMouth # random choice from two mouth shapes
  - main # go to (-100, 0) draw a random face, go to (100, 0) draw a random face

You might also want to copy/paste some functions from previous projects, such as [Turtle Arguments and Shapes](http://bradleycodeu.github.io/apcsp/turtleart/turtleArgumentsAndShapes/)

You MUST use the tracer to speed up the animation. You could set tracer(0) at the top of your code and update() at the bottom. Another option is to set the tracer to 100 or larger.

If you are working with a partner, you MUST randomly select pencolor and fillcolor.

Here are a few examples. Each time your app runs it might randomly draw TWO of these...

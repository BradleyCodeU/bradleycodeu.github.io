 Big Shape Lil Shapes

Working as a team, decide on what shapes (or simple drawings) you want to make. 

For example...
- a big pentagon made of little hexagons
- a big hexagon made of little triangles
- a big triangle made of little stars
- a big star made of little squares
- a big pentagon made of little triangles
- a big hexagon made of little stars
- a big Yoda face made of little Yoda faces

Next, demonstrate your algorithmic thinking by writing code to draw your designs.

  - You MUST define a function that will draw your little shape using forward(), backward(), left(), right()
  - You MUST use 20 or more little shapes to draw your big shape.

As a group, define a main() function that asks the user "What drawing do you want?" and allows the user to type a number. Say "Invalid" if the number is invalid. Ask the user what color they want. Then draw the drawing that the user wants in that color. For example...
```
What drawing do you want?
1 = a big Yoda face made of little Yoda faces
2 = a big Death Star made of little stars
Type a number: 99999
Invalid Number!
```



Your finished drawings should ```NOT``` look like a spiral/swirl. Here are a few examples of what your finished drawing should ```NOT``` look like:

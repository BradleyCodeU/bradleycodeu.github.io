title: Turtle How Many Squares
---
[Read this tutorial about using Python's input() function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp)

Define a function named isValidNumber that requires one argument (myNumber) and returns True or False if myNumber is valid. For this project, any integer 1-10 is valid.

Define a function named drawSquare() that draws a single square.

Define a main function named main(). Inside of that function...

  - Ask the user "How many squares? Type 1-10" and save their answer in a variable named userAnswer

  - If isValidNumber(userAnswer) is True, then draw that many squares. Otherwise, print "Not a valid number"

Squares should be drawn one after another in a straight line. All squares must be visible! If I ask for 5, I must be able to see 5.

NOTE: You MUST use a "for i in range()" loop so that the project is less than 30 lines of code.

title: Turtle Algorithm Plan
---


For this 1-point assignment, you are simply submitting your PLAN for the next assignment, 2.1.9DrawingAlgorithm

Pick one unique design.

You **must** tell Mr. Riley what you plan on drawing **before** you begin 2.1.9DrawingAlgorithm (the next project).

For example…

*   a big pentagon made of little hexagons
*   a big hexagon made of little triangles
*   a big triangle made of little stars
*   a big star made of little squares
*   a big pentagon made of little triangles
*   a big hexagon made of little stars

Here are a few examples of what your finished drawing might look like: ![Turtle algorithm examples](https://bradleycodeu.github.io/apcsp/turtleart/drawingAlgorithm.PNG)

I will **NOT** accept your plan if you submit "a big triangle made of little triangles" or something **_basic_** like that.

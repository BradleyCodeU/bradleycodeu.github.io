"Op Art" is a style of optical illusion art from the 1960's. One of the most famous op art paintings is [Movement in Squares by Bridget Riley](https://www.google.com/search?surl=1&biw=1536&bih=758&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=bridget+riley+movement+in+squares&oq=bridget+riley+movement+in+squares&safe=active&ssui=on)

In this project you will create an Op Art drawing.

You have used a ```for i in range``` loop before, but we haven't used the variable ```i```. For this project, we will use ```i``` to slowly adjust the space between columns.

Try running this code in python and you will see that ```i``` is a variable that is being updated every time the loop repeats.
```python
for i in range(10):
  print(i)
```

### DIRECTIONS

Define a function that will draw ONE COLUMN from top to bottom. You will use this in the algorithm below. You could draw a vertical column of squares, circles, triangles, stick people, houses, or anything.

Main Algorithm:
- Pick pen up
- Go to the top-left corner of the screen
- Create a for i in range loop, then
  - Pen down
  - Call your function that draws one column
  - Pen up
  - Go back to the top
  - Set heading east
  - Move forward i

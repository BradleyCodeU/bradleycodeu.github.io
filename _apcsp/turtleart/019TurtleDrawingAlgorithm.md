Pick one unique design.

Let Mr. Riley know what you plan on drawing.

For example...
- a big pentagon made of little hexagons
- a big hexagon made of little triangles
- a big triangle made of little stars
- a big star made of little squares
- a big pentagon made of little triangles
- a big hexagon made of little stars
Next, demonstrate your algorithmic thinking by writing code to draw your design.

I recommend defining a function that will draw your little shape using forward(), backward(), left(), right()

You MUST use 20 or more little shapes to draw your big shape.

Here are a few examples of what your finished drawing might look like:

Your finished drawing should NOT look like a spiral/swirl. Here are a few examples of what your finished drawing should NOT look like:

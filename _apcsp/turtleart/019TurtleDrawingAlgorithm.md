Pick one unique design.

You ```MUST``` tell Mr. Riley what you plan on drawing ```BEFORE``` you begin.

For example...
- a big pentagon made of little hexagons
- a big hexagon made of little triangles
- a big triangle made of little stars
- a big star made of little squares
- a big pentagon made of little triangles
- a big hexagon made of little stars

Next, demonstrate your algorithmic thinking by writing code to draw your design.

  - You MUST define a function that will draw your little shape using forward(), backward(), left(), right()
  - You MUST use 20 or more little shapes to draw your big shape.

Your finished drawing should ```NOT``` look like a spiral/swirl. Here are a few examples of what your finished drawing should ```NOT``` look like:

Here are a few examples of what your finished drawing SHOULD look like:

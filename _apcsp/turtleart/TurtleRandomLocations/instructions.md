# Turtle Drawings At Random Locations
---
Pick two simple drawings from the list below (ghost and pumpkin, for example). You MAY re-use your code from the TrtSimpleDrawing project for one of them.

Define a function that will draw a single ghost (for example). Pick a color for this drawing (not black and white).

Define another function that will draw a single pumpkin (for example). Pick another color for this drawing (not black and white).

Define a main function named main() in which you:

  -  draw a bunch of your first drawing at random locations on 1/2 of the screen
  -  draw a bunch of your second drawing at random locations on the other 1/2 of the screen


Call your main function at the end of your file.

Here are some of the basic Python Turtle commands you may need:
```python
from turtle import *
tracer(0)
Turtle()
penup()
goto()
pendown()
color()
pencolor()
fillcolor()
begin_fill()
forward()
left()
right()
end_fill()

```

### GOLD MEDAL CHALLENGE

Make each item a random color.

Instead of just randomly picking a location... generate a random number and round it to the nearest 50th. Your drawings will be randomly placed on a 50x50 grid.

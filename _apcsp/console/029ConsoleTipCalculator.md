You ```MUST validate the input using Try/Except``` or the program will crash.

You can learn how to validate user input [here](https://www.101computing.net/number-only/) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp)

  - Ask the user how much the bill is (for example, 19.99 or 173.52). *MUST BE ABLE TO CALCULATE DECIMAL NUMBERS*

  - Collect the user's input, validate that it is a number, and store it in a variable.

  - Ask what percent they want to tip (for example, 15 or 20).

  - Collect the user's input, validate that it is a number, and store it in a variable.

  - Ask the user if they have a coupon, yes or no.

  - If yes, ask the user how much the coupon will subtract from the bill (for example, 5.50 or 0.99).

  - Collect the user's input, validate that it is a number, and store it in a variable.

  - *QUESTION 4*: Make up your own question. Make it fun. For example... How much would you like to donate to my college fund? or How much money do you want to steal from the restaurant? or Would you like to sign up for a Target Red Card? or What grade did you get in math class? or Are you paying in cash or credit card? or How much wood could a woodchuck chuck? Collect the user's input and then use an if/then conditional to reply one way or another.

  - Tell the user how much money they should tip.

  - Tell the user what the total will be with the tip added and the coupon subtracted.

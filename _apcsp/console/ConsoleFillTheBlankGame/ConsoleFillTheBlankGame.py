# Create an empty array called correctAnswers and an empty array called wrongAnswers

# Define a function called askQuestion. It requires two arguments: questionText, answerText. Inside this function will be:
  # a while True loop
    # ask the questionText
    # collect user input
    # convert the user input to lowercase letters
    # if user input does NOT equal the answerText (NOTICE: THIS PLACES THE CONDITION AT THE END OF THE LOOP)
      # say incorrect try again
    # else:
      # say correct
      # break the loop

# Display instructions for the player like in the Sample Output

# Create at least 6 (or 10 if working with partner) "Fill in the Blank" style questions.

# The game will only move on to another question when you get the question right.

# Print "Your wrong answers were: " and print the array of user's wrongAnswers.

# Finally, print "Your correct answers were: " and print the array of user's correctAnswers.

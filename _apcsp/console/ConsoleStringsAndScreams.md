Write a code to prompt the user to enter their first name. Your program will respond with a welcome message for the user (Hello Steve!) and then print some information about the user's first name (length, starts with, ends with).

Next, prompt the user to enter their last name. Print some information about the user's last name (length, starts with, ends with).

Print the full name (Your full name is Steve Jobs).

Print your nick name is then the first 2 letters of your last name plus the first 2 letters of your last name. Read this article about [how to slice a string in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp).

Finally, scream! Create a variable named myScream that contains empty string. Make a loop that repeats for the length of the first name + the length of the second name, concatenating an "A" to myScream each repetition. After the loop, concatenate an "!" and print it.

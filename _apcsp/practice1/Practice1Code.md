NOTE: You MAY complete the coding part of this project with a partner. If you work with a partner, write 7 or more quiz questions.


## Create an Educational Multi-Choice Quiz

Computers are playing an increasing role in education. Write a program that will help a student learn basic fundamentals in math, science, a foreign language, etc.

Code Specifications:

	-	Contains at least 5 or more MULTI-CHOICE quiz questions. For example, "Where is the Eiffel Tower? 1 = London, 2 = Paris, 3 = New York, 4 = Tokyo" and the user might type in 2 as their answer.
	-	MUST have a function called validNumber that requires one argument: userInput. It returns True if the userInput is between 1 and 4 (inclusive) and returns False otherwise.
	-	MUST notify the user if their answer is "correct" or "incorrect"
	- If the users types in an invalid number (999, for example) then you must notify the user "999 is NOT a valid answer"


When Finished:

  - Each person will turn in a copy of your finished Python code as a PDF file. Why a PDF? Because you will turn in a PDF of your code for the AP exam.
  - One easy way to save your code as a PDF is to copy/paste it into a Google Doc. In Google Docs, select File > Download > PDF to save as a PDF.


## Below are the directions from The College Board

PROGRAM CODE (CREATED INDEPENDENTLY OR COLLABORATIVELY)

Submit one ```PDF file``` that contains all of your program code (including comments). Include comments or acknowledgments for any part of the submitted program code that has been written by someone other than you and/or your collaborative partner(s). IMPORTANT: If the programming environment allows you to include comments, this is the preferred way to acknowledge and give credit to another author. However, if the programming environment does not allow you to include comments, you can add them in a document editor when you capture your program code for submission.

In your program, you must include student-developed program code that contains the following:

*   Instructions for input from one of the following:
    *   the user (including user actions that trigger events)
    *   a device
    *   an online data stream
    *   a file 
*   Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose IMPORTANT: The data abstraction must make the program easier to develop (alternatives would be more complex) or easier to maintain (future changes to the size of the list would otherwise require significant modifications to the program code).
*   At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose, where you have defined:
    *   the procedure’s name
    *   the return type (if necessary)
    *   one or more parameters IMPORTANT: Implementation of built-in or existing procedures or language structures, such as event handlers or main methods, are not considered student-developed.
*   An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure
*   Calls to your student-developed procedure
*   Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality)

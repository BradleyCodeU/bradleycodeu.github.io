Go to [https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2018/stage/4/puzzle/3](https://studio.code.org/s/csp2-2018/stage/4/puzzle/3)
  - Set the Image Width to 4 or 5
  - Set the Image Height to 4 or 5
  - Set the Bits Per Pixel to 3 or 6
  - Keep BINARY selected

Notice that the first three bytes are the metadata (width, height, and bit depth). Here is the metadata for a 3-bit 5x4 bitmap:
```
0000 0101
0000 0100
0000 0011
```
Here is the metadata for a 6-bit 4x5 bitmap:
```
0000 0100
0000 0101
0000 0110
```

## Project Details

Using binary, create a bitmap that is 4x4 or larger. Must use two or more colors and you can NOT include black or white. Draw a small image (not just a pattern) OR a letter from your initials. For example, Justin Riley would either draw a pixelated J or a pixelated R.

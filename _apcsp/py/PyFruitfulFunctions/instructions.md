[Read this tutorial first](https://bradleycodeu.github.io/apcsp/py/pythonfunctions)

Mr. Riley has created 4 weird functions and he needs you to test them to make sure that they work correctly. Write 2 tests for each function (8 total tests).

Test a function by “calling” the function and passing an argument into the function. countVowels(“Computer”) should return 3.

REMEMBER: Each of these functions WILL return a result. You MUST save the result in a variable AND then print that variable.

For example, the code below would test a validYear function. With the argument 2009, the coder is expecting it to say True. Finally, run the test, get the actual result and print it.

```
# Test 1
print("Test 1 of validYear function")
print("Argument: 2009")
print("Expected: True")
# Run the test and get the actual result
actual = validYear(2009)
print("Actual Result: " + str(actual))
```

### For each test you MUST:
  - Print what argument(s) you are testing
  - Print what output you are "expecting"
  - Run the test and get the actual result
  - Print the actual result


## Challenge

Mr. Riley thinks that these functions are actually broken... there is some input that will not produce the correct/expected output.

Test several values until you find an outlier, a value that doesn't work as expected. At most... run 10 different test. You might want to try different data types. 

If you can find outliers, add a print statement with your theory about what inputs won't work correctly.

If you don't find an outlier after 10 tests, then just move on.

Copy/paste this starter code: [https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/Menu-Calc](https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/Menu-Calc)

Display a menu with prices for THREE items (for example, burger $4.99, chicken sandwich $3.99, and one other item). Collect how many of item 1, how many item 2, and how many item 3.

You MUST include...
- Labels for item names and prices
- an Entry widget for each item (so the user can say how many they want).
- a Button

When the customer clicks the SUBMIT button, validate numbers, calculate the total price, create a popup that tells the customer the total price.

When finished, press the run button. If no errors, then Submit. After you submit your code to repl.it classroom, come back to Canvas and type "done" for this assignment.



Starter Code:
```python

def magicTrick():
  # REMINDER: All your code MUST be indented by 2 spaces
  # Use the print function to say "Hello World"
  print( )
  # Create variable named magicNumber & set it to any number you like

  # Print magicNumber. I will do this step for you
  print(magicNumber)
  # Create variable named stepOne & set it to magicNumber multiplied by 2

  # Print stepOne

  # Create variable named stepTwo & set it to stepOne plus 10

  # Print stepTwo

  # Create variable named stepThree & set it to stepTwo divided by 2

  # Print stepThree

  # Create variable named stepFour & set it to stepThree minus magicNumber

  # Print "The next number should be 5"

  # Print stepFour

  # YOU SHOULD BE DONE! Press the run button. If no errors, then Submit
  return stepFour

magicTrick()

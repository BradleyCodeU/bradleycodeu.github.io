title: Py Magic Trick
---

In this project you will demonstrate print statements, assigning a value to a variable, & arithmetic operators.

Complete the starter code to recreate a simple magic trick from [https://nrich.maths.org/1051](https://nrich.maths.org/1051)

Create a new Python project and copy/paste the Starter Code below. When finished, press the run button. If no errors, then show Mr Riley.


Starter Code:
```python
# Fill in ALL 12 blanks with the correct code.
# Blanks look like this: ???

def magicTrick():
    # REMINDER: All your code MUST be indented by 4 spaces
    # Use the print function to say "Hello World"
    print( ??? )
    # Create variable named magicNumber & set it to ANY number you like
    ???
    # Print magicNumber. I will do this step for you
    print(magicNumber)
    # Create variable named stepOne & set it to magicNumber multiplied by 2
    ???
    # Print stepOne
    ???
    # Create variable named stepTwo & set it to stepOne plus 10
    ???
    # Print stepTwo
    ???
    # Create variable named stepThree & set it to stepTwo divided by 2
    ???
    # Print stepThree
    ???
    # Create variable named stepFour & set it to stepThree minus magicNumber
    ???
    # Print "The next number should be 5.0"
    ???
    # Print stepFour
    ???
    # use the str() function to convert the stepFour variable to a String
    stepFour = ???(stepFour)
    # YOU SHOULD BE DONE! Press the Run button. If no errors, then Submit
    return stepFour

result = magicTrick()
print("\nExpected : 5.0 \nYour code: " + result)
```

In December of 2019, thousands of fake reviews were posted for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker on RottenTomatoes.com. The fake review were most likely created with a spambot, a random text generating algorithm similar to the random name generator that you will create.

According to [ReclaimTheNet.org](https://reclaimthenet.org/new-data-shows-strange-patterns-in-rotten-tomatoes-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-audience-reviews/), variations of the phrase “great end to the saga” appear more than 260 times. The large amount of short, similar “great end to the saga” comments is very different from the reviews on another site, Metacritic.com. On Metacritic, most reviews are longer, more varied, and discuss what the reviewer liked or disliked about the movie. Reviews that are variations of “great end to the saga” and nothing else are very hard to find.

In 2017, 22 million comments were filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about Net Neutrality, the issue of whether all web traffic should be treated equally. According to the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/11/29/public-comments-to-the-federal-communications-commission-about-net-neutrality-contain-many-inaccuracies-and-duplicates/), 94% of comments were submitted multiple times with some comments being copied hundreds of thousands of times. The seven most-submitted comments (six of which argued against net neutrality protection) made up 38% of all comments. According to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/14/570262688/as-fcc-prepares-net-neutrality-vote-study-finds-millions-of-fake-comments), on several occasions tens of thousands of comments came in at the same precise moment.

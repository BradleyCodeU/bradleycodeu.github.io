Follow the directions in the PDF, then also...

- Use the "Set Rotation Style" code block to keep the enemies from flipping upside-down.
- Add a 4th enemy that is unique. It looks different and behaves differently than all of the other bad guys. Everyone in class will have a unique 4th enemy.
- Add a variable for High Score.
- If the Score is greater than High Score, set High Score to be Score.

title: Hungry Bug
---

When the green flag is pressed, a timer is set to 20 and starts counting down. After 20 seconds, the game is over and everything stops.

There are four apples. We will start the game showing one in each corner. The apples move very slowly at random angles and bounce off of the walls. If an apple is touching the bug, that apple hides and the bug gets a point.

The player is a hungry bug. They start in the center. When the player presses left, the bug rotates left. When the player presses right, it rotates right. When the player presses up, it moves forward in whatever direction it is facing.

If the player gets 4 points, then the beetle says "You Win."

*NOTE:* Your game will probably be *too easy* and the player wins 100% of the time. *Without changing the timer*, what can you add/change to increase the difficultly and make it so that the player only wins 25-50% of the time?

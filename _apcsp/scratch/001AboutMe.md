Introduce yourself with Scratch!

Your first Scratch assignment is to create a scenario in which a sprite introduces you to your classmates.

Creating Your Game:

1.	Delete the cat. Choose any other sprite from the Scratch library to represent yourself. This is your avatar.

2.	Choose any backdrop from the library and insert it into your scene.

3.	Now it is time to write your script (or program). First, you will tell the program *when* to display the speech bubble. From the “Events” scripts menu choose “When the green flag is clicked”. Every block that is connected to this event will be executed in the order specified.

4.	Your avatar will be talking to some stranger, so choose the “say” block from the “Looks” scripts menu. Type your narrative in the field where “Hello!” originally appears. Make sure to adjust the number of seconds so that your text can be read easily.


Requirements:

Include the following information in your dialogue.
* Say "Welcome Stranger" or "Howdy Stranger" or something like that. Remember that the character on screen represents you and this app will be run by a stranger that you don't know.
* Ask the stranger "What's your name?"
* If the stranger's answer equals "Hilliard"
  * Change the color effect by 25
* Otherwise
  * Say "Hello _____" using the stranger's answer
*	Say your name (the coder's name). For example, "My name is John Smith"
*	Say why you (the coder) are taking this class
*	Say your current career aspirations
*	Say your favorite part of the school day
*	Say your least favorite part of the school day
*	Say what activities/athletics in which you plan to participate
*	Say anything else you would like to share
* Say "Goodbye _____" using the stranger's answer

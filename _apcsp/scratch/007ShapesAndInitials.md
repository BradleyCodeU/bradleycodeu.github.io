For the following assignment, you will NOT use xy coordinates. Instead, you will use "Move ?? Steps" and "Turn ?? Degrees." You must also use "Repeat ??" loops whenever possible.

Write multiple scripts so that...
  -  When the green flag is pressed, the pen is down.
  -  When the space bar is pressed, it clears away all drawings.
  -  When the up arrow is pressed, it draws a triangle.
  -  When the left arrow is pressed, it draws a square.
  -  When the down arrow is pressed, it draws a pentagon.
  -  When the right arrow is pressed, it draws a rectangle.
  -  When the a letter from your initials is pressed, it draws that letter. For example... my initials are J.R. If I press the J key, it draws J. If I press the R key, it draws R.

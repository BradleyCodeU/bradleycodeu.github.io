  title: Bouncing Off The Walls
---
Switch the sprite to any animal other than the cat.

Write code so that when the green flag is clicked, your sprite:

1. Is always moving forward
2. Bounces off the walls
3. Use the pen to trace its path
4. Legs are moving (or it's wings are flapping or whatever)
5. Does not flip upside down
6. Turns slightly randomly so that it's not just moving in straight lines. You should be using the random numbers block "pick random 1 to 10" to do this.


*NOTE: Do NOT use the "go to random position" block or the "glide 1 secs to random position" block. If you use those, then your sprite isn't actually bouncing off the walls.*

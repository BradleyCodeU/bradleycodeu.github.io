  title: Bouncing Off The Walls
---
Switch the sprite to any animal other than the cat.

Write code so that when the green flag is clicked, your sprite:

1. Is always moving forward
2. Bounces off the walls
3. Use the pen to trace its path
4. Legs are moving (or it's wings are flapping or whatever)
5. Does not flip upside down
6. Moves at random angles

Here are some [Scratch Tutorial videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128oYSzZetK25nTV-0YInwofJ_TrGKf3W?usp=sharing), I recommend watching the one about Jumping

Move your sprite to the bottom of the stage, so that it looks like it's standing on the ground.

Create multiple scripts so that:
- When the right arrow is pressed, it faces right, moves forward, and it's legs move.
- When the left arrow is pressed, it faces left, moves forward, it's legs move, and it does NOT flip upside-down.
- When the space bar is pressed, it slowly jumps up and then slowly comes back down to the ground.

Add a non-player character (NPC) that:
- Automatically walks from the left side of the screen to the right side of the screen
- If it reaches the right side of the screen (it has an x position >= 240), then set its x position to -240

Raise your hand when finished

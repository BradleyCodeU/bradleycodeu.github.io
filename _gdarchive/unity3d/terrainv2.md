In addition to the mountains, grass, hills, shrubs, and first/third person camera from Terrain proj 1, you will add the following:

- adjust the Directional Light so that Shadows have a Strength somewhere between 0.5 and 0.75. The default setting (1) is too extreme.

- Water. [Watch the tutorial](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o_n-_BgOu_1RtUqavS9ubGz63pca5R0V)

- Download the Unity Post-Processing Stack [from Github](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing), unzip it and move the unzipped folder into your Assets folder
- Go to Assets > Create > Post Processing Profile and name it "Underwater"
- Click on the FirstPersonCharacter and in the hierarchy and add the following components: Post Processing Volume and Post Processing Layer.
- In the Post Processing Layer, the Trigger slot should say "FirstPersonCharacter" and you must set the Layer drop-down to Everything.
- In the Post Processing Volume, place a check next to Is Global and drag the "Underwater" profile into the Profile slot. Next, click the Add Effect button at the bottom of the Post Processing Volume. Add bloom, vignette, and some blue color grading.
- Add a new script to the FirstPersonCharacter. Name this script controlPostProcess.
  ```
  using UnityEngine.Rendering.PostProcessing;
  private PostProcessVolume volume;
  volume = gameObject.GetComponent<PostProcessVolume>();
  volume.enabled = false;
  ```
- your underwater Post-Processing Profile will give the camera a blue haze when underwater. Watch the [How To Create Underwater FX tutorial video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lsFiEbqzo0u6EuoXLDo_E9q0xRFRL0j5). NOTICE that this tutorial version *is for an older version of Unity*, but the video will demonstrate how to setup the water as a trigger for the post-processing.

- enable fog by going to Window > Lighting > Settings and checking the Fog checkbox

- [SketchUp](https://app.sketchup.com/app) house (with brick, wood, glass, etc textures and with cut-out doors the player can walk through). Once your SketchUp house is built, click File > Export > 3D Model. Select *OBJ* format (not DAE). Select your Unity project assets folder, then click Options. Check the Export Two-sided Faces checkbox. Then click OK and Export. In Unity, add a mesh collider to the walls so the player can't walk through them

- 3 or more collectibles (review the [Roll A Ball project's Counting Points video](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Ty6SYENccamq1nSBsfRZE4daQkKmZIZr) if you don't remember how)
- Make your collectibles glow by adding a child Point Light or Area Light
- UI Text that tells the player how many collectables they've collected (for example, "0 of 5 collected" OR "0/5 collected")
- UI Text that tells the player "You Win" if all collectibles are collected

- A reset script, just in case the player falls off of the world. Reset script reminder... you only need these 3 lines of code. You should know where to put these by now.
```
private Vector3 startpos;

startpos = new Vector3(gameObject.transform.position.x, gameObject.transform.position.y, gameObject.transform.position.z);

if (transform.position.y < -10) transform.position = startpos;
```
